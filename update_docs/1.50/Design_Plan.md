# Version 1.50 Design Plan

## Vision & Objectives
The Version 1.50 design initiative elevates Fixnado’s experience to an enterprise-grade, omni-channel standard. Building on the module inventories inside the Application and Web design update folders, this plan orchestrates the rollout of unified design tokens, responsive templates, and theme-aware partials that can be executed across React, Flutter, and marketing touchpoints.

Primary objectives:
1. **Create a cross-platform design system** that converges typography, colour, spacing, and interaction patterns across web, provider, and user applications.
2. **Modernise critical journeys**—home, explore, dashboards, storefronts, creation studio, and compliance workflows—using reusable partials and templates.
3. **Introduce theme flexibility** (default, industrial, premium, emo) with accessibility-first guardrails and compliance alignment.
4. **Enable rapid experimentation** through modular sections, dummy-data scaffolding, and clear widget behaviour specifications.
5. **Support security and governance goals** by embedding privacy cues, consent states, and audit trail visibility in the interface.

## Strategic Design Pillars
- **Consistency & Systemisation:** Adopt a single token source (colour, typography, elevation, motion) synchronised via design tooling (Figma/UXPin) and exported to frontend/mobile tokens.
- **Accessibility & Compliance:** Guarantee WCAG AA across all states, inclusive motion settings, localisation readiness (LTR/RTL), and compliance messaging surfaces.
- **Modularity & Partial Layouts:** Provide a library of page sections (hero, feature grid, testimonial, CTA, footer) that can be arranged per page, including partial overlays for campaigns.
- **Role-Based Personalisation:** Ensure dashboards, menus, and notifications adapt to user roles, with contextual quick actions and AI-assist toggles.
- **Theme Extensibility:** Offer emo and premium variations through adjustable accent palettes, typography tone, and imagery guidelines without fragmenting the system.

## Platform Alignment
### Web Application
- Implement responsive breakpoints (320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px) with adaptive layout rules for navigation, cards, and data tables.
- Rebuild landing and marketing pages with modular partials for hero, proof, pricing, and CTA sections, supporting both single-scroll and multi-section home experiences.
- Update dashboards (user, provider, enterprise, admin) with analytics summaries, task boards, compliance banners, and quick filters.
- Refactor forms with inline validation, progressive disclosure for advanced settings, and security copy for sensitive actions.

### User & Provider Applications (Flutter)
- Align navigation architecture with the updated web IA while using platform-native components (Material 3) skinned by shared tokens.
- Implement tabbed/drawer hybrids for larger devices, preserving gesture-based shortcuts and accessible focus rings.
- Update booking, messaging, finance, and compliance screens with refreshed cards, chip groups, and micro-interactions.
- Provide offline and loading states consistent with web skeleton patterns.

### Shared Design Assets
- Maintain unified iconography, illustration, and photography guidelines with emo-themed overlays and cultural localisation tips.
- Create token export pipelines (Style Dictionary or similar) that deliver JSON/Sass/Flutter formats.
- Document animation easing curves, durations, and motion safety preferences.
- Extend the status messaging component library to cover rate-limit, CORS, and consent prompts so visual treatments mirror the hardened backend responses.
- Publish privacy surface specifications for consent receipts, encrypted data disclosures, and breach notification banners aligned with new PII storage safeguards.

## Page & Flow Redesign Scope
| Area | Key Enhancements | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Home & Marketing** | Hero carousel, segmented CTA buttons, partner proof tiles, dynamic testimonials, emo theme overlays. | Supports partial page injection for campaigns and AB testing. |
| **Explore & Search** | Faceted filters, map/list sync, availability chips, card quick actions, empty states. | Aligns with new geozone ranking logic and AI recommendations. |
| **Dashboard Shells** | Role-aware sidebars, KPI ribbons, task queues, compliance alerts, quick-action drawers. | Mirrors logic flows defined in `Logic_Flow_map.md`. |
| **Creation Studio** | Modular wizard steps, inline previews, theme pickers, content validation, audit timeline. | Supports partial saving and theme-based preview toggles. |
| **Finance & Disputes** | Escrow timeline visualisation, payout cards, dispute resolution checklist, compliance footers. | Ensures parity between web dashboards and Flutter finance modules. |
| **Settings & Profiles** | Security badges, consent preferences, integration toggles, avatar management, audit logs. | Draws on `Settings Dashboard.md` and `Profile Look.md`. |
| **Support & Compliance Pages** | GDPR portal, accessibility statement, security and privacy copy blocks. | Connects to compliance and legal deliverables. |

## Theme Strategy
1. **Default Theme:** Neutral blue/teal palette for enterprise operations with muted gradients, standard imagery.
2. **Industrial Theme:** Deep greys, safety yellows, rugged textures for heavy machinery campaigns.
3. **Premium Theme:** Dark charcoal with gold accents, luxurious photography, serif headings for high-end vendors.
4. **Emo Theme:** High-contrast neon accents, textured backgrounds, alternative typography pairings for youth/creative segments.

Each theme inherits the base typography scale and spacing while overriding accent colours, imagery treatments, and button states. Theme tokens will be stored as layered overrides so partial sections can switch without reauthoring base components.

## Governance & Collaboration
- **Design Ops Cadence:** Weekly design reviews with product/design leads, monthly compliance walkthroughs, and cross-platform syncs.
- **Version Control:** Utilise shared design libraries with semantic versioning (e.g., 1.50.x) and changelog alignment with `Design_Change_log.md`.
- **Developer Handover:** Provide annotated specs, component usage guidelines, accessibility checklists, and interactive prototypes.
- **Quality Gates:** Establish design QA criteria, including screenshot diffs, Figma tokens vs. code parity, and theme regression tests.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Fragmented theme implementation across teams | Inconsistent brand experience, accessibility violations | Centralised token service, design QA checklist per theme, automated visual regression. |
| Partial layout misuse or duplication | Bloat and longer load times | Authoring guidelines, CMS constraints, and component usage linting. |
| Emo theme clashing with compliance copy | Reduced trust, legal escalations | Provide alternate copy tone, compliance overlays, and gating for regulated flows. |
| Flutter/web divergence | Increased maintenance, inconsistent UX | Shared token export pipeline, cross-platform QA sessions. |
| Asset delivery lag | Placeholder images on launch | Preload CDN asset packs, provide fallback illustrations, automated asset inventory checks. |

## Deliverables & Artefacts
- Updated component specifications covering cards, forms, buttons, chips, navigation, and overlays.
- Theme token packages (JSON/Sass/Flutter) with documentation and usage samples.
- Page templates and partial layout library with breakpoints and state diagrams.
- Accessibility and compliance checklist per flow including test cases.
- Handoff bundle for developers with redlines, annotations, and sample data for QA environments.

## Approval Criteria
- Sign-off from Product Design, Engineering, Compliance, and Marketing stakeholders.
- Accessibility verification (WCAG AA) across default and emo themes.
- Responsive prototypes validated on target device classes.
- Integration of design tokens into CI pipelines for web and Flutter repositories.
