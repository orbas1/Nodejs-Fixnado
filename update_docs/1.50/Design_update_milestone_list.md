3. ✅ Creation studio stepper, preview panes, and theme selector interactions documented.
4. ✅ Creation studio autosave, compliance checklist, and publish confirmation flows documented for web and Flutter parity.
5. ✅ Finance and dispute resolution layouts featuring escrow timelines, payout summaries, and alerts.
6. Partial layout catalogue with usage rules, asset specifications, and dummy-data scaffolding.
7. Provider dashboard data-alignment review against restored panel services to confirm layout assumptions remain valid.
8. Compliance data governance metrics pack capturing KPI cards, due-date table states, advanced filter forms, and refresh micro-interactions aligned with the new SLA analytics.
9. Finance escalation ribbon & responder workflow specs covering alert drawers, Slack/Opsgenie affordances, and retry countdown treatments for web and Flutter dashboards.
10. Explorer ranking heuristics documentation detailing demand/compliance weighting, availability modifiers, price cues, and offline fallback ordering with parity notes for Flutter explorer cards and QA instrumentation.
11. Live feed streaming design kit covering SSE status headers, offline cache banners, reconnection UX, and analytics instrumentation notes aligned with backend event contracts.

## Milestone D4 – Mobile Parity & Thematic Extensions (Target Week 5–7)
**Goals:** Ensure Flutter implementations mirror web patterns, and theme variants (premium, emo) are production ready.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Mobile-specific component adaptations (cards, forms, chips, navigation) mapped to shared tokens.
2. Emo and premium theme art direction boards with imagery, iconography, and motion guidance.
3. Responsive behaviour matrices covering breakpoints, device classes, and orientation states.
4. Offline/loading/error state illustrations and microcopy guidelines.
5. Cross-platform regression scripts for design QA (visual diff, accessibility, localisation).
6. Live feed parity artefacts specifying Riverpod/React status banners, reduced motion fallbacks, and accessibility cues for streaming telemetry.
7. Biometric unlock flows, secure-session banners, and token status indicators aligned with backend session hardening.
8. Fatal error recovery blueprints capturing Flutter restart loops, diagnostics consent copy, and telemetry payload summaries aligned with the React error boundary experience.

## Milestone D5 – Mobile Parity & Component Adaptation (Target Week 7–9)
**Goals:** Translate web patterns into Flutter-ready components with parity across user and provider apps while addressing device-specific ergonomics.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Flutter component adaptations for workspace hub, creation studio, finance dashboards, and compliance consoles aligned to shared tokens.
2. Tablet breakpoint guidance covering split-column layouts, safe-area padding, and multi-pane behaviours for navigation surfaces.
3. Haptic, motion, and accessibility notes ensuring Material 3 interactions mirror web ergonomics without sacrificing performance.
4. Asset and iconography packs sized for 1x/2x/3x densities with export checklists from `App_screens_drawings.md`.
5. Riverpod/controller interaction blueprints for parity-critical flows (workspace hub, explorer, finance alerts) with analytics instrumentation hooks.
6. Mobile-specific QA scenarios verifying gesture handling, offline states, and request-access workflows for new navigation entry points.

### Progress Update (2025-04-14) – Workspace Hub Parity
- Flutter parity pack for the workspace hub documents card hierarchy, bottom-sheet preview flows, and request-access dialog copy so deliverables 1, 3, and 6 advance to sign-off with engineering evidence.
- Shared navigation descriptors now link mega menu, dashboard hub, and Flutter navigation entries, raising milestone completion to **96%** while keeping assets in sync with `Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `App_screens_drawings.md`.
- Added tablet breakpoint guidance, safe-area padding, and haptic/responsive behaviours to the parity bundle, ensuring mobile-specific notes remain production ready for the remaining milestone checklists.

## Milestone D6 – Design QA, Documentation & Handover (Target Week 8–10)
**Goals:** Finalise QA evidence, documentation, and multi-team handover packages to de-risk launch of the 1.50 experience refresh.
