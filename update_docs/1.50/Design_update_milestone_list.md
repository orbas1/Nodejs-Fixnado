# Version 1.50 Design Milestone Plan

## Milestone D1 – System Foundations & Tokenisation (Target Week 1–2)
**Goals:** Finalise design tokens, typography scales, spacing rules, and baseline components across application and web scopes.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Consolidated colour palettes (default, industrial, premium, emo) with WCAG AA verification.
2. Shared typography scale and variable font strategy documented for React and Flutter builds.
3. Component baseline specs for cards, buttons, forms, chips, and alert banners.
4. Token export pipeline prototype (JSON/Sass/Flutter) connected to design tooling.
5. Accessibility checklist for foundational components including focus states and keyboard interactions.
6. Status and alert token expansions covering rate limiting, CORS denial, and consent prompts aligned with backend copy.
7. Privacy and consent banner patterns referencing encrypted data handling, breach notices, and audit log confirmations.

## Milestone D2 – Navigation & Information Architecture Alignment (Target Week 2–4)
**Goals:** Harmonise navigation, menu structures, and logic flows while incorporating compliance and security cues.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Updated IA diagrams reflecting mega menu, dashboard sidebars, quick actions, and Flutter navigation parity.
2. Breadcrumb, notification tray, and contextual action patterns with responsive behaviour.
3. Compliance messaging placements (consent, privacy alerts, security banners) across page types.
4. Emo theme adaptation guidelines for navigation and header/footer treatments.
5. Usability test plan and findings summary for navigation prototypes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
6. RBAC navigation blueprint translating the hardened backend matrix into role-specific landing routes, menu groupings, and badge placements for web and Flutter shells.

## Milestone D3 – Page Templates & Partial Layout Library (Target Week 3–6)
**Goals:** Rebuild priority pages and partial sections for marketing, dashboards, creation studio, and finance experiences.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Home, Explore, and campaign landing templates with modular hero/feature/testimonial/CTA sections.
2. Role-based dashboard shells including analytics ribbons, task queues, and compliance widgets.
3. Creation studio stepper, preview panes, and theme selector interactions documented.
4. Finance and dispute resolution layouts featuring escrow timelines, payout summaries, and alerts.
5. Partial layout catalogue with usage rules, asset specifications, and dummy-data scaffolding.
6. Provider dashboard data-alignment review against restored panel services to confirm layout assumptions remain valid.

## Milestone D4 – Mobile Parity & Thematic Extensions (Target Week 5–7)
**Goals:** Ensure Flutter implementations mirror web patterns, and theme variants (premium, emo) are production ready.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Mobile-specific component adaptations (cards, forms, chips, navigation) mapped to shared tokens.
2. Emo and premium theme art direction boards with imagery, iconography, and motion guidance.
3. Responsive behaviour matrices covering breakpoints, device classes, and orientation states.
4. Offline/loading/error state illustrations and microcopy guidelines.
5. Cross-platform regression scripts for design QA (visual diff, accessibility, localisation).
6. Biometric unlock flows, secure-session banners, and token status indicators aligned with backend session hardening.

## Milestone D5 – Design QA, Documentation & Handover (Target Week 7–9)
**Goals:** Complete design QA, documentation packages, and engineer handover for implementation readiness.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Comprehensive design QA checklist results covering accessibility, theming, and parity.
2. Annotated specs, redlines, and prototype links for all priority flows.
3. Updated design change log and versioned library release notes.
4. Developer enablement kit (component usage guides, token documentation, asset inventory).
5. Stakeholder sign-off records (Product, Engineering, Compliance, Marketing).
