# Widget Updates â€“ User App

- Introduced Riverpod providers for `SecureCredentialStore`, `AuthTokenController`, and `BiometricAuthenticator` so downstream features can gate navigation, API clients, and notifications on authenticated session state.
- Added `ConsentController` and `ConsentOverlay` presenters that subscribe to the consent API client, expose ledger-backed policy states, and coordinate biometric unlock with legal acceptance before resuming app navigation.
