# Backend Integration Updates â€“ User App

- Updated the authentication client to call `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/session/refresh`, and `/api/auth/logout` with mobile-specific metadata so the backend issues bearer tokens while also maintaining secure cookies for web flows.
- Persisted backend-issued session identifiers, access scopes, and expiries inside the new secure credential vault to support auditing and proactive refresh scheduling from the device.
- Documented the cookie + token interplay so QA can verify that mobile logins continue to function without cookies while browsers rely on httpOnly storage.
- Extended the legal API client to invoke `/api/consent/snapshot`, `/api/consent/decisions`, and `/api/consent/verify`, aligning request payloads with the ledger requirements (channel metadata, region codes, anonymous subjects).
- Captured Opsgenie escalation metadata returned from booking creation to support future in-app trust notifications once the mobile dashboards surface risk insights.
- Added compliance API integration for `/api/compliance/data-requests` including create, list, status update, and export endpoints with retry-safe request bodies and localisation-aware region codes.
- Normalised GDPR request payloads to trim emails, attach Riverpod-provided justification, and persist audit messages for offline replay.
- Implemented `/api/compliance/data-warehouse/runs` client support with paginated fetch, manual trigger POSTs, and polling of long-running exports using exponential backoff tuned for mobile connectivity constraints.
- Mapped warehouse export responses into strongly typed models capturing dataset, region, actor, record counts, checksums, storage paths, and retention deadlines so the UI can surface actionable operations context without additional API calls.
