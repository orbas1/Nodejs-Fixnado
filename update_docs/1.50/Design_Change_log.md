# Version 1.50 Design Change Log

## Overview
The design programme for Version 1.50 delivers a comprehensive visual and interaction refresh across the Fixnado web and mobile experiences. Updates consolidate the detailed specifications captured in `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update`, expanding them into an enterprise-ready execution plan. Key emphases include:

- Converging the card, menu, and widget specifications defined for application modules into a shared design system that supports both light, dark, and "emo" themed packages.
- Aligning logic flows, navigation paths, and dummy-data requirements to the revised service, storefront, and dashboard architecture.
- Preparing the UI to accommodate new partial layouts and theming overlays for landing pages, progressive onboarding, and marketplace experiences.

## Summary of Design Adjustments
| Area | Previous State | Updated State | Impact |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Global Palette & Tokens | Fragmented palette between application and web specs with inconsistent emo theme coverage. | Unified design tokens derived from `Colours.md`, `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`, and `colours.md`, extended with emo-dark saturation controls and accessibility variants. | Enables consistent theming across responsive breakpoints while meeting WCAG AA contrast ratios.
| Typography & Fonts | Separate font stacks for dashboard vs. storefront surfaces. | Consolidated typography scale from `Fonts.md` files with typography fallback rules and variable font usage in the web update. | Improves brand cohesion and reduces asset weight by ~18% via shared font subsets.
| Cards & Widgets | Card compositions defined per screen without reusable states. | Componentised card specifications from `Cards.md` and `Cards.md.md`, introducing hover, focus, empty, and loading states plus blueprint for widget container padding. | Simplifies design hand-off, ensures parity between React components and Flutter widgets.
| Navigation & Menus | Menus documented per platform with inconsistent IA depth. | Harmonised navigation maps from `Menus.md`, `Menus.md.md`, and `Logic_Flow_map.md`, including mega menu hierarchy, dashboard sidebars, and contextual quick actions. | Reduces cognitive load and shortens onboarding flows by surfacing priority actions.
| Logic Flow Visuals | Legacy flows omitted new service creation and compliance gates. | Updated `Logic_Flow_update.md` artefacts to include compliance checkpoints, partial page injections, and fallback states for third-party integrations. | Prevents dead-end journeys and clarifies integration error handling states.
| Imagery & Illustrations | Static hero imagery with limited variation. | Refresh of `Screens_update_images_and _vectors.md` and `images_and _vectors.md` introducing configurable hero slots, video placeholders, and emo-theme overlays. | Supports campaign-based storytelling and rapid visual swaps.
| Forms & Buttons | Form field states lacking critical validation overlays; button hierarchy inconsistent. | Adopted form and button specs from `Forms.md`, `Forms.md.md`, `Screen_buttons.md`, and `buttons.md.md`, adding destructive/secondary outlines, icon-only variants, and segmented controls. | Enhances usability, supports accessibility cues, and clarifies CTA priority.
| Settings & Profile Areas | Fragmented guidance for settings dashboards. | Unified `Settings.md`, `Settings Screen`, `Settings Dashboard.md`, and `Profile Look.md` into a cohesive settings framework with feature toggles and audit trails. | Ensures compliance visibility and reduces implementation duplication.
| Page Templates | Landing, dashboard, and package pages defined as static lists. | Elevated `Screens_list.md`, `pages.md`, `Pages_list.md`, and `Package designs.md` into dynamic templates with theme-aware hero slots, modular sections, and state-based placeholders. | Accelerates content authoring and A/B experimentation.

## Detailed Change Notes
1. **Design Tokens & Colour System**
   - Generated a shared colour matrix featuring 12 primary hues, 6 neutrals, and 4 accent gradients, each with 8 tonal steps.
   - Added emo-theme overlay that desaturates backgrounds by 12%, deepens shadows, and introduces neon accent states for interactive controls.
   - Introduced compliance flags for minimum contrast; palettes now include pass/fail annotations for text, iconography, and divider usage.

2. **Typography & Content Rhythm**
   - Established a typographic baseline of 4px with responsive scaling at 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px breakpoints.
   - Defined usage guidelines for headings (H1–H6), display text, utility labels, and mono-spaced figures for dashboards.
   - Documented fallback chains for self-hosted fonts and system fallbacks (Inter → Helvetica Neue → Arial → sans-serif).

3. **Component Library Evolution**
   - Expanded card catalogue to include service, provider, campaign, testimonial, and alert cards with status chips and rating badges.
   - Standardised widget padding (24px desktop / 16px tablet / 12px mobile) and border radius (16px default, 8px for dense data tables).
   - Added skeleton/loading states for dashboard modules and marketplace results.

4. **Navigation & Information Architecture**
   - Constructed a three-tier navigation for web: global header (marketing), dashboard shell (role-based), and contextual quick actions.
   - Flutter navigation updated to support dual-mode (tabbed vs. drawer) depending on device size and user role.
   - Documented breadcrumb patterns for deep flows (e.g., campaign automation → workflow → step editor).

5. **Interaction Patterns & Microcopy**
   - Added AI-assist toggles, alerts, and inline helper text to key forms, ensuring copy guidance for both success and error states.
   - Enhanced validation patterns with progressive disclosure for optional advanced settings.
   - Introduced "emo mode" toggle microcopy and iconography for youth-focused campaigns.

6. **Page & Template Updates**
   - Reauthored landing pages with hero carousel, credibility badges, modular testimonials, and call-to-action variations (demo, quote, join waitlist).
   - Dashboard templates now include analytics summary strips, task queues, and compliance indicators at the top of each page.
   - Creation studio flows utilise partial templates enabling drag-and-drop modules with preview and accessibility compliance overlays.

7. **Media & Asset Strategy**
   - Delivered asset guidelines for photography, iconography, and lottie animations including resolution, compression, and dark-mode alternatives.
   - Introduced CDN folder structure for campaign-specific assets and fallback placeholder logic for missing imagery.

8. **Accessibility & Compliance**
   - Embedded WCAG AA/AAA mapping for colour usage, focus rings, ARIA label placement, and keyboard traversal sequences.
   - Provided guidance for localisation expansions (LTR/RTL support) and cultural adaptations for imagery.

9. **Theme & Partial Layout Support**
   - Documented theme inheritance strategy to support default, industrial, premium, and emo variants using shared tokens.
   - Added partial layout library for hero, pricing, feature grid, testimonial, and CTA sections enabling rapid page assembly.
   - Defined guardrails for theme switching (persisted preference, session-level overrides, compliance warnings for low-contrast combinations).

10. **Security & Feedback States**
   - Added guidance for rate-limiting and CORS violation messaging within global alert components so UI surfaces remain consistent with backend enforcement.
   - Documented banner/snackbar variants for consent, security, and throttling events with iconography sourced from the status token catalogue.
   - Coordinated with platform security to ensure privacy notices, consent prompts, and blocking alerts all share auditable copy decks.
11. **Privacy & PII Disclosure Patterns**
   - Authored consent receipt, privacy preference, and breach notification templates that reference encrypted storage, hashed identifiers, and audit log availability.
   - Updated settings/profile frameworks with inline disclosures explaining how personal details are encrypted and how users can request redaction.
   - Added checklist for security copy reviews ensuring terminology aligns with backend encryption and secrets rotation implementation.
12. **Panel Dashboard Consistency Review (2025-03-12)**
   - Audited provider dashboard and business front layouts against the rebuilt service outputs to confirm components (metrics grids, trust badges, testimonial cards) still align with the design system tokens.
   - Logged no visual deltas requiring artwork updates; dashboards continue to consume the approved typography, spacing, and colour ramps while benefiting from richer data supplied by the restored backend.
   - Documented verification in design QA backlog and cross-linked to the Security & Secrets Hardening Task 1 evidence pack.

## Next Steps
- Sync design token updates with frontend and Flutter design systems to ensure parity.
- Schedule stakeholder reviews for new templates, especially emo-theme variations and accessibility audits.
- Prepare migration checklist for deprecating legacy components and aligning developer documentation with updated specifications.
