# Design Change Log â€“ Version 1.50

## Overview
The Version 1.50 release introduces a coordinated design evolution across the Fixnado mobile applications and the enterprise web console. Updates consolidate findings from the **Application Design Update Plan** and **Web Application Design Update** workstreams, focusing on navigation clarity, component consistency, accessibility compliance, and AI-assisted workflows.

## Mobile Application Changes
### Navigation & Information Architecture
- Re-architected dashboard navigation so booking approvals, campaign insights, and compliance alerts are available within one tap from the landing screen.
- Introduced persona-aware quick actions that adapt to provider versus user journeys, retaining common patterns through a shared token library.
- Added breadcrumb and backstack guidance within multi-step booking and bidding flows, with persistent status chips for in-progress tasks.

### Visual System & Tokens
- Updated colour palette to align with refreshed gradient tokens and high-contrast neutrals defined in the **Colours** and **Screen_update_Screen_colours** specifications.
- Adopted unified typography hierarchy (Display, Title, Body, Caption) per the **Fonts** directive, with fallback fonts for offline scenarios.
- Refined card elevations, padding, and iconography across listing, campaign, and compliance widgets, consolidating specifications from **Cards**, **Screens_Update_widget_functions**, and **Screen_buttons** documents.

### Content & Copy
- Revised checklist microcopy and contextual helper text across forms referencing the **Screen_text** and **Dummy_Data_Requirements** guides.
- Embedded AI-generated recommendation slots in booking, campaign, and dispute resolution flows with transparent rationale messaging.

### Interaction & Flow
- Streamlined booking wizard, campaign setup, and dispute mediation flows using the consolidated **Logic_Flow_map** and **Logic_Flow_update** diagrams.
- Added inline validation states, progress indicators, and motion cues to align with accessibility and reduced-motion requirements.
- Expanded image/vector usage in onboarding and marketing surfaces based on the **Screens_update_images_and _vectors** library.

## Web Application Changes
### Layout & Navigation
- Restructured home page and dashboard modules to support persona switching and AI-driven highlights, leveraging **Dashboard Organisation** and **Pages_list** references.
- Introduced responsive navigation rails, breadcrumb scaffolding, and mega-menu treatments per **Menus.md.md** and **Home Page Organisations.md**.

### Component System
- Consolidated component library (cards, tables, overlays, forms) with state-specific variants defined in **component_types.md**, **component_functions.md**, and **Forms.md.md**.
- Updated CSS/SCSS tokens to align with new colour and spacing scales, referencing **Colours.md**, **colours.md**, **Css.md**, and **Scss.md** docs.
- Implemented dark mode support and reduced-motion fallbacks with toggles surfaced through **Settings Dashboard.md**.

### Content & Imagery
- Refreshed hero messaging, compliance disclosures, and pricing copy as directed in **Home page text.md** and **text.md.md**, including localisation hooks.
- Curated new imagery sets for campaigns, provider showcases, and testimonials, sourcing from **Home page images.md** and **images_and _vectors.md**.

### Workflow & Logic
- Integrated geo-intelligent recommendations, compliance guardrails, and AI nudges across dashboards based on **Logic_Flow_map.md** and **Logic_Flow_update.md**.
- Enhanced booking and rental lifecycle dashboards with escalations and SLA tracking derived from **Function Design.md** and **Dashboard Designs.md**.
- Added consent checkpoints and audit trails throughout forms, aligning with security and compliance requirements.

### Operational Governance & Incident UX (New)
- Introduced operations cockpit concepts aligned with the infrastructure promotion checklist, surfacing deployment status, Terraform plan reviews, and alarm feeds within the admin console.
- Added guidance overlays referencing the backup/DR runbook so administrators can trigger failover or rollback flows directly from the UI with contextual documentation links.
- Updated persona matrices to include Platform Ops and Security Engineering roles, clarifying access scopes for promotion, rotation, and incident management tools.

### Implementation Tooling & Quality Guardrails (New)
- React, Node, and Flutter workstreams now share an ESLint 9 flat configuration with PropTypes validation, JWT-safe logging patterns, and Prettier suppression to keep the design system output accessible.
- Dependency governance CI enforces Express 5, Sequelize 6.37, Vite 6, and Flutter lockfiles so component libraries inherit the latest security patches without design token drift.
- Added PropTypes baselines to live-feed and service card templates, guaranteeing data contracts between design specs and production components remain synchronised during handoff.

## Accessibility & Compliance Enhancements
- Achieved WCAG 2.1 AA baseline by refining colour contrast, focus states, and semantic markup guidelines.
- Documented consent, verification, and data retention flows for GDPR alignment within both mobile and web experiences.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Requires synchronised token delivery to frontend repositories (React, Blade, Flutter) before QA sign-off.
- Demands backend support for enriched analytics, dummy datasets, and compliance data to populate new dashboards.
- Pending validation of reduced-motion and dark mode variants on legacy devices; flagged for additional testing.

## Approvals & Status
- **Design Leadership:** Approved hi-fidelity mocks and interaction playbooks.
- **Product Owners:** Provisionally approved pending completion of moderated usability tests.
- **Engineering Leads:** In review while Storybook/Tailwind token updates are finalised.
