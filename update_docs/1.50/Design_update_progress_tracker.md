> **Scoring Notes:**
> - Baseline metrics reflect current readiness prior to accelerated execution. Only foundational token and accessibility research (Task D1) show measurable progress.
> - **Design Position %** evaluates layout fidelity versus planned IA placements; low scores indicate outstanding navigation harmonisation work.
> - **Design Render Grade %** measures prototype maturity (motion, transitions, high-fidelity states). Most tasks remain in wireframe or specification stages.
> - **Compliance & Security Grades** track integration of privacy prompts, consent cues, and security messaging within the design artefacts.
> - Task D1 security score increased after documenting rate-limit and CORS alert tokens that align with the hardened backend behaviours.
> - Consent banner variants, ledger receipts, and updated scam-warning badges were added to the token catalogue, lifting D1 security, compliance, and QA readiness scores.
> - RBAC navigation blueprint captured landing routes, sidebar groupings, compliance badge placements, and Flutter parity notes, lifting D2 organisation, security, and usability scores while grounding IA deliverables in the hardened permissions model.
> - Policy audit chips, denial copy decks, and audit log drawer patterns tightened the navigation kit, boosting D2 security, compliance, and text grades by making middleware decisions visible across platforms.
> - Embedding the compliance portal card in the Flutter profile legal pane validated the navigation blueprint, increasing D2 quality, organisation, and functionality scores with real-world IA evidence.
> - **Overall Grade %** is an average of all recorded metrics, rounded to the nearest whole number.
> - Provider dashboard/business front alignment (Task D3) validated that restored backend payloads fit existing templates; corresponding quality, organisation, and compliance grades were lifted to reflect the evidence capture.
> - Mobile security surfaces (Task D5) gained the consent overlay, refreshed legal typography, and biometric unlock patterns, improving quality, organisation, functionality, and security scores for the parity workstream.
> - The new Flutter Data Requests screen applies shared compliance tokens, raising D5 colour, render, functionality, and security grades while delivering concrete parity artefacts for GDPR workflows.
> - Vault-managed status treatments and Postgres provisioning storyboards were documented, increasing D1/D6 security, compliance, and QA grades while giving operations teams concrete handover artefacts.

## Action Items to Improve Scores
1. Accelerate token export automation and accessibility validation to raise D1 Quality and QA scores before dependent tasks commence.
2. Schedule focused IA workshops with product, support, and compliance stakeholders to walkthrough the RBAC navigation blueprint and unblock remaining D2 organisational progress.
3. Prioritise partial template production for home and dashboard pages to demonstrate tangible improvements in D3 render and usability scores.
4. Prototype emo and premium themes early to detect imagery or contrast issues impacting D4 colour and accuracy grades.
5. Align Flutter and web component libraries through shared Storybook/Widgetbook sessions to lift D5 functionality and accuracy marks.
6. Establish design QA workflow with test automation (visual diffs, accessibility audits) to strengthen D6 test and QA grades ahead of implementation.
