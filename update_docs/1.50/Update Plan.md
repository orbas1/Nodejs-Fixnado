# Version 1.50 Update Plan

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 will transform Fixnado into an AI-augmented, hyper-local service marketplace. Delivery hinges on closing critical backend, database, and mobile gaps while introducing zone intelligence, collaborative job workflows, monetisation panels, and rigorous compliance tooling. This plan synthesises findings from the feature briefs, existing plans, and issue analyses to orchestrate a cross-stack release that is secure, observable, and production ready.

## Guiding Objectives
- Resolve pre-update issues blocking enterprise readiness across backend security, schema integrity, dependency/tooling hygiene, and client parity.
- Implement feature pillars: geospatial zone intelligence, flexible bookings, marketplace rentals/inventory, AI-assisted communications, compliance/trust, and monetisation dashboards.
- Maintain aligned experiences across web, backend Node.js services, Flutter-based phone apps (user and provider), and future enterprise panels.
- Embed quality assurance, observability, and governance to sustain continuous delivery and regulatory compliance (GDPR/UK standards).
