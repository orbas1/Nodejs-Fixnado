   - Zone selection cascades to job visibility filters and ads targeting.
   - Conflict detection prompts immediate resolution or team reassignment suggestions.
3. **Job Intake & Qualification**
   - Incoming leads pass through risk scoring (payment history, dispute flags) before surfacing in Job Board.

## Automation & AI Enhancements
- **AI Suggestions:** Provide context-aware responses, bidding heuristics, and compliance reminders using provider-specific data.
- **Event Stream Hooks:** Each state change emits events for analytics dashboards, SLA monitoring, and notification services.
