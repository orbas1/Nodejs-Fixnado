# Web Application Logic Flow Changes (v1.50)

## Navigation & Routing
- Implement unified navigation service that updates breadcrumbs, header highlights, and dock states based on route metadata; ensures deep links maintain context.
- Role-based guards redirect unauthorised users to request access modal while logging attempts for security audit.
- Quick search command palette fetches entities (jobs, providers, resources) with typeahead suggestions; selecting result opens modal or new tab depending on entity type.

## Dashboard Logic
- Dashboard widgets now lazy-load data streams; each widget emits loading, success, and error states to central store for consistent skeleton handling.
- Action queue prioritisation algorithm factors SLA breaches, compliance deadlines, and unread approvals; items escalate to "Critical" column when thresholds met.
- Operations Timeline merges job, maintenance, and audit events sorted by start time; clicking event opens detail drawer pre-populated with relevant actions.

## Marketplace Flows
- Marketplace search filters sync with URL query params enabling shareable states; clearing filters resets to persona defaults (e.g., procurement vs. operations).
- Quote request drawer collects data across tabs; validation ensures each step completed before enabling submission; once submitted, API call triggers notification and logs event.
- Provider comparison logic allows selecting up to three providers; comparison table renders capabilities, SLAs, pricing tiers, and ratings side-by-side.

## Resource Hub & Support
- Resource hub filter interactions update results without page refresh using incremental fetching; bookmarking article adds to personalised quick access list.
- Article feedback widget sends rating + optional comment to analytics service; negative feedback prompts optional support ticket creation.
- Release note timeline integrates with changelog API, caching results per session; pagination loads older entries seamlessly.

## Settings & Administration
- User management table supports inline role edits; changes queue until "Save" pressed, then batch update API call ensures atomicity; rollback if any update fails.
- Integrations settings include OAuth connection flows; success triggers status badge update and confirmation email.
- Audit log viewer loads entries with infinite scroll; filters by actor, action, timeframe update query and persist across sessions.

## Reporting & Exports
- Report builder ensures filter selections stored in draft state; saving as template shares with org or personal scope based on permission selection.
- Export scheduler validates cron-like recurrence inputs; generating export triggers background job and notifies subscribers via email with download link.

## Compliance Operations Console
- Warehouse export panel queries latest runs on load, presenting dataset cards with run summaries; selecting a dataset filters the run table and reveals manual trigger CTA with dataset-specific prerequisites.
- Manual trigger flow enforces justification entry, dataset validation, and retention acknowledgement before calling the backend; progress indicator polls run status every 15 seconds with exponential backoff when idle.
- Error states provide remediation actions (retry export, view troubleshooting doc, contact security) while success surfaces download and DPIA documentation buttons alongside retention countdown chips synced from run metadata.

## Error Handling & Observability
- Global error boundary captures unexpected issues and displays recovery modal with support link; errors tagged with correlation ID for diagnostics.
- Telemetry events instrumented for navigation search usage, widget refresh, quote submissions, resource feedback, settings saves, and export completions with timestamps and actor metadata.
