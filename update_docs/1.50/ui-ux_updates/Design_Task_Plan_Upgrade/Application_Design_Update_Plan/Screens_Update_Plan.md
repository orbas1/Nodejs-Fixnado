# Screen Update Plan

## Phase Breakdown
### Phase 1 – Foundations (Week 1)
- Finalise screen inventory and prioritisation using MoSCoW framework.
- Review existing analytics to identify pain points per screen.
- Align with engineering on technical constraints (API availability, offline storage limits).

### Phase 2 – Wireframing & Validation (Week 2)
- Produce low-fidelity wireframes for top-priority flows (onboarding, dashboard, job detail).
- Conduct internal design critique and iterate based on feedback.
- Validate with 3 providers via remote usability sessions; capture insights.

### Phase 3 – High-Fidelity Design (Week 3)
- Apply updated styling tokens, typography, and component library.
- Annotate interactions, states, and microcopy directly in Figma.
- Partner with copywriter for tone alignment; ensure localisation placeholders accounted for.

### Phase 4 – Documentation & Handoff (Week 4)
- Compile annotated PDFs, redlines, and component references for development.
- Update logic flow diagrams and analytics mapping for each screen.
- Record walkthrough video demonstrating navigation and interactions.

### Phase 5 – QA & Iteration (Week 5+)
- Support engineering during implementation with async feedback.
- Prepare acceptance checklist for each screen (accessibility, performance, data accuracy).
- Gather beta feedback post-release and log follow-up tasks.

## Dependencies
- Component library updates from Design Systems by Week 2.
- Backend availability endpoints for scheduling conflicts by Week 3.
- Analytics event schema updates by Week 4.

## Deliverables & Tracking
- Jira tickets per screen referencing design file, requirements, and acceptance criteria.
- Confluence summary with links to assets, research findings, and meeting notes.
- Status dashboard maintained daily to reflect progress (Planned → In Design → Review → Handoff → Dev Support).
