# Application Design Update Summary

## Objectives
- Deliver a cohesive provider-facing mobile experience that accelerates onboarding, streamlines job execution, and clarifies financial insights.
- Harmonise interaction patterns with web surfaces while respecting native mobile conventions for iOS and Android.
- Ensure every screen meets accessibility standards, handles offline resilience, and communicates system feedback with clarity.

## Key Pillars
1. **Foundational structure:** Establish modular screen templates for dashboard, wizard flows, detail views, and communication hubs with reusable components.
2. **Visual consistency:** Apply shared typography, colour, and spacing tokens; define light/dark mode strategies and high-contrast adaptations.
3. **Workflow efficiency:** Map the end-to-end provider journey and reduce redundant steps through automation, quick actions, and context awareness.
4. **Data transparency:** Surface actionable metrics, progress indicators, and alerts at decision points.
5. **Scalability:** Document component behaviours and data dependencies to enable rapid iteration and localisation.

## Deliverables
- Updated wireframes for 28 screens covering onboarding, dashboard, job management, communications, financials, settings, and support.
- Detailed logic flow diagrams describing state transitions, error handling, and offline sync rules.
- Styling specifications for components, typography, icons, and illustrations with export guidance.
- Widget inventory enumerating components, data sources, events, and dependencies.
- QA-ready checklists for validation of accessibility, localisation, and performance metrics.

## Timeline & Milestones
- **Week 1:** Finalise discovery notes, approve screen list, validate personas, and map baseline analytics instrumentation.
- **Week 2:** Produce high-fidelity wireframes for core flows (onboarding, dashboard, jobs) and review with stakeholders.
- **Week 3:** Expand to financial and settings modules, integrate styling updates, and align with component library tokens.
- **Week 4:** Deliver comprehensive documentation, annotate logic flow maps, and prepare development handoff package.
- **Post-release:** Conduct usability tests, gather telemetry insights, and schedule iteration backlog for v1.51.

## Stakeholders & Collaboration
- Product Management (provider experience), Design Systems, Mobile Engineering, Data Analytics, and Support Operations.
- Weekly design critiques and async reviews ensure alignment; Jira epic `MOB-2150` tracks task progression with dependencies flagged.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep:** Use prioritised backlog with MoSCoW classification; any new features require change request and resource review.
- **Platform divergence:** Maintain platform-specific notes within documentation; enforce shared component usage where feasible.
- **Data availability:** Coordinate with backend teams to confirm API readiness for new metrics; include fallback states for missing data.
