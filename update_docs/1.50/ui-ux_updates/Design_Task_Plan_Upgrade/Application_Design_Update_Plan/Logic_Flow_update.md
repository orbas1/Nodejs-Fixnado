# Logic Flow Update Checklist

## Summary of Changes
- Introduced new branches for persona-specific onboarding, compliance verification escalation, and offline upload retries.
- Refined job acceptance sequence to include conflict checking, negotiation, and fallback recommendations.
- Added payout dispute resolution flow connecting financial module with support queue.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Audit existing flow diagrams** to identify outdated nodes and naming inconsistencies.
2. **Document new states** in Figma with unique IDs; ensure each has screen reference and interaction notes.
3. **Update analytics instrumentation plan** to map events to states/edges; confirm naming convention `provider_<flow>_<action>`.
4. **Review with engineering** to validate technical feasibility and identify additional edge cases.
5. **Publish updated PDFs and flow summaries** to Confluence and share with QA for test case creation.

## Validation Criteria
- Every user action should have defined success, failure, and cancel paths.
- Offline scenarios must be accounted for with retry/resume logic.
- Security-sensitive transitions (login, bank update) require multi-factor confirmation steps.
- Ensure flows align with updated copywriting and status messaging.

## Dependencies
- Requires confirmation from backend on new API endpoints for action queue priority and payout disputes.
- Ensure design tokens for new status states (critical, warning) exist before handoff.

## Next Steps
- Translate flow updates into interaction specs per screen.
- Schedule playthrough session with support team to walk through rare scenarios and gather feedback.
