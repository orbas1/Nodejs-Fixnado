# Logic Flow Update Summary

The application logic emphasises:
- **Closed-loop operations:** every booking, bid, and compliance event feeds analytics and triggers notifications.
- **AI governance:** consent gating ensures AI suggestions appear only when users opt-in; flows store consent artefacts.
- **Offline resilience:** actions queue locally with conflict resolution prompts during sync.
