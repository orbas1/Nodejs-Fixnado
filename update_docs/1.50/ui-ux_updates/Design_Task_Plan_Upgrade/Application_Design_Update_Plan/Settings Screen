# Settings Screen Blueprint

## Screen Goals
- Provide a centralised hub for account, notification, security, and support preferences.
- Reduce confusion by grouping related settings and surfacing status indicators.

## Layout
- Header: Screen title, short description, profile avatar.
- Sections: Notifications, Security, Payment & Payouts, Accessibility, Support.
- Each section uses card-like container with list items; essential status info displayed on right (e.g., "MFA Enabled").
- Persistent footer button for "Export account summary".

## Key Interactions
- Tapping list item opens detail screen or bottom sheet (e.g., Notification Preferences, Payment Methods).
- Toggle switches provide immediate feedback with toast confirming update.
- Security actions (password change, MFA) require re-authentication modal.

## Accessibility
- Ensure focus order matches visual order; each section header announced to screen readers.
- Provide descriptive text for toggles ("Push notifications for job updates").
- Support dynamic type and voice control.

## Empty/Error States
- If payment info missing, display callout with CTA to add bank details.
- Error retrieving settings shows inline alert with retry option and link to support.

## Analytics
- Track interactions per section `settings_section_opened`, `settings_toggle_changed`, `settings_security_action` with metadata.
