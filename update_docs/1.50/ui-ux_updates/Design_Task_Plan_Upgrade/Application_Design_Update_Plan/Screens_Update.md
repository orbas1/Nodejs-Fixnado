## Approach
- Start with low-fidelity adjustments validated via stakeholder review, then progress to high-fidelity mocks.
- Each screen documented with annotations for interactions, states, and copy.
- Figma components linked to design system library for consistent updates.

## Success Metrics
- Achieve <3 taps to critical actions (accept job, update availability).
- Reduce onboarding completion time to <10 minutes.
- Improve readability scores by increasing contrast and layout clarity.

## Collaboration
- Weekly demos with product/engineering; asynchronous comments tracked in Figma.
- QA and support teams review flows for edge cases and documentation accuracy.
