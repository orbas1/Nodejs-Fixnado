# Screen Text Guidelines

- **Tone:** Trustworthy, supportive, and action-oriented. Avoid jargon, emphasise clarity on compliance and pricing.
- **Microcopy:** Provide context for AI actions ("AI suggestion - review before sending"), explain deposit policies, highlight response expectations.
- **Error Messaging:** Specific, solution-driven ("Upload a valid DBS certificate issued within the last 12 months.").
- **Empty States:** Encourage next steps ("No bids yet. Providers are reviewing your request â€“ expect updates within 2 hours.").
- **Success States:** Reinforce outcomes and follow-up ("Booking confirmed! Track progress in your timeline and prepare for the visit.").
