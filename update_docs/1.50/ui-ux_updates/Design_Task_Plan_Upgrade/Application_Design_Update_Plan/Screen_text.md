# Screen Copy & Messaging Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- Professional yet supportive; speak directly to providers with clear action-oriented language.
- Avoid jargon; when technical terminology required, include short explanations or tooltips.
- Use second-person perspective to reinforce guidance ("You can update your availability" vs. "Availability can be updated").

## Content Patterns
- Screen titles follow "Action + Context" structure (e.g., "Review Job Details", "Update Availability").
- Subtitle lines provide context or highlight deadlines ("Complete verification to unlock bookings").
- Inline helper text uses short sentences, emphasises benefits, and links to knowledge base where appropriate.

## Error Messaging
- Explain what happened, why, and how to resolve ("We couldnâ€™t verify your document. Upload a clearer photo or contact support.").
- Avoid blame; provide contact options if self-service fix unavailable.
- For destructive confirmations, confirm irreversible nature and provide alternative options.

## Success & Progress Messaging
- Celebrate milestones with encouraging copy ("Great job! Your availability is live.").
- Provide next-best actions to keep momentum ("Invite your team to manage schedules").

## Accessibility & Localization
- Ensure copy remains meaningful when translated; avoid idioms.
- Keep button labels under 24 characters where possible; use tooltips or helper text for extended explanations.
- Provide accessible labels for icons describing function ("Open knowledge base").

## Content Maintenance
- Maintain central glossary of product terminology to ensure consistency.
- Review copy each release for accuracy as workflows evolve.
