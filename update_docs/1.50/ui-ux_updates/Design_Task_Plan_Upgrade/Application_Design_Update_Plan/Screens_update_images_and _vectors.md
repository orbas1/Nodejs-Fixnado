# Imagery & Vector Asset Plan

## Requirements
- Provide high-resolution illustrations for onboarding, verification, and success states reflecting industrial context and diversity.
- Update iconography to align with new features (action queue, compliance, dispute, availability templates).
- Ensure assets optimised for multiple densities (1x/2x/3x) and dark mode variants.

## Asset Categories
1. **Illustrations**
   - Personas (Solo operator, Fleet manager).
   - Verification success/failure scenes.
   - Financial wellness imagery for payouts and tax reminders.
2. **Icons**
   - 24px stroke icons for navigation and quick actions.
   - 16px solid icons for badges and statuses.
   - Lottie animations for success confirmation (<150kb).
3. **Photography**
   - Dashboard background hero referencing cranes, logistics operations.
   - Use licensed stock or in-house photography with permissions documented.

## Production Guidelines
- Maintain consistent stroke weight (1.5px) and corner radius (4px) across icons.
- Export SVG for vector-based assets; PNG fallback for compatibility.
- For dark mode, adjust hues to maintain contrast (e.g., lighten indigo backgrounds, add outlines).

## Asset Management
- Store in shared library `Design/Assets/v150/app/` with naming convention `surface_component_state@2x.png`.
- Document usage rights and attribution requirements.
- Provide redlines for placement and size per screen in Figma.

## Review Process
- Run accessibility checks (contrast, recognisability) on all assets.
- Validate file sizes meet performance thresholds (<100kb for static, <150kb for animations).
- Stakeholder review to ensure imagery aligns with brand tone and inclusivity guidelines.
