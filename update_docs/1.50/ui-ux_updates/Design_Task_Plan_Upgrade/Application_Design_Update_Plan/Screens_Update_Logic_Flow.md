# Screen Logic Flow Alignment

## Objectives
- Ensure each redesigned screen aligns with updated logic flows and state transitions documented for v1.50.

## Process
1. Map each screen to corresponding flow nodes (e.g., `ONB-STEP1`, `JOB-DETAIL`, `FIN-PAYOUT`).
2. Identify triggers entering and exiting each screen: navigation, push notifications, deep links, offline resumes.
3. Document error states and fallback behaviours directly on screen specs.
4. Validate analytics events fire at entry, exit, and primary action points.

## Example Mapping
- **Verification Timeline Screen**
  - Entry triggers: dashboard action queue, onboarding progression, push reminder.
  - Exit triggers: completion → success modal; partial → remind later; failure → support contact.
  - States: steps complete/in progress, manual review, escalation.
- **Job Detail Screen**
  - Entry from job list, notifications, deep link.
  - Child flows: start work (→ timeline), message provider (→ chat), upload files (→ attachments), report issue.
- **Payout Detail Screen**
  - Entry from financial summary card, payout notification.
  - Handles dispute flow, export receipt, view history.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Screen ID documented and consistent across design, analytics, and code base.
- [ ] Success/failure modals align with logic flows.
- [ ] Navigation breadcrumbs or back stack behave as defined.
- [ ] Edge cases (offline, permission denied) reflected in UI states.

## Deliverables
- Annotated screen specs referencing logic flow nodes.
- Updated click-through prototype demonstrating transitions.
