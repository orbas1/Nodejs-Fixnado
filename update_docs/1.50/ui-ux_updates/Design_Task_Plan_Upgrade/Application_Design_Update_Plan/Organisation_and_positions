# Layout Organisation & Element Positioning

## Dashboard Layout
- Top section: KPI grid (two rows, three columns) aligned under header with 16px gutter, ensures metrics above fold.
- Right rail: Action queue stack anchored to scroll with page; collapses on smaller screens to carousel under KPI grid.
- Bottom area: Community insights and resource cards arranged in horizontal scroll.

## Job List
- Header with filter chips, search, and sort dropdown anchored above list; sticky when scrolling.
- Job cards stacked vertically with 12px spacing; status tags aligned top-right; quick actions on right edge within 48px touch area.

## Job Detail
- Hero section displays job summary, location map snippet, and quick actions in row; secondary tabs below.
- Timeline component left-aligned; message thread occupies remainder of screen with composer anchored bottom.

## Availability Planner
- Weekly view uses horizontal day tabs at top, vertical timeline below; quick templates row sits above timeline.
- Status drawer slides from bottom covering 60% height; close button top-right accessible with large tap target.

## Financials
- Summary cards arranged horizontally with scroll snapping; transaction list below with sticky filter bar.
- Detail sheet emerges from bottom with large header, breakdown table, and dispute CTA anchored.

## Settings
- Section list grouped by headings; toggles align right with consistent spacing; CTAs anchored at bottom for save/cancel.

## Alignment Principles
- Use 8px baseline grid; align icons/text to maintain visual rhythm.
- Maintain 24px padding from screen edges; cards/trays use 16px internal padding for content clarity.
