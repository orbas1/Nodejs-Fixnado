# CSS Guidelines

- Use CSS variables for colour tokens, spacing, and typography to support theming.
- Adopt BEM naming for legacy components; prefer utility classes for new features.
- Enable prefers-reduced-motion support by disabling transitions when requested.
- Optimise bundle via code-splitting and purge unused classes.
