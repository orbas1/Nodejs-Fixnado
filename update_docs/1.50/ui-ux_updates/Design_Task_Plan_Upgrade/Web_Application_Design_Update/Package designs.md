- **Card Layout:** Showcase package title, included services, price tiers, savings, and zone coverage.
- **Comparison Table:** Allows side-by-side evaluation of packages with key metrics.
- **Callouts:** Highlight AI-recommended package and limited-time promotions.
- **Add-ons:** Display optional extras with checkboxes and updated totals.
