# Package Design Principles

## Card Layout
- Display package name, target persona, included services with icons, pricing tiers (monthly, annual), and savings badge.
- Include coverage map showing service zones; highlight AI-recommended option with accent border and "Recommended" tag.
- Provide toggle for billing frequency and button for "Compare" and "Select".

## Comparison Table
- Columns for packages, rows for features (service hours, response time, compliance level, add-ons).
- Sticky first column listing features; include icons indicating included/optional/not available.
- Provide tooltip on hover describing feature and compliance implications.

## Promotions & Bundles
- Allow promo banners (e.g., "Save 20% for first 3 months") with expiry countdown.
- Add cross-sell modules recommending complementary add-ons (e.g., asset rental bundle).

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Convert table to accordion on mobile; ensure CTA remains visible.
- Provide clear copy about contract terms and cancellation policies.
