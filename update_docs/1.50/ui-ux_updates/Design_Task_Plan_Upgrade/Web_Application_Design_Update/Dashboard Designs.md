# Dashboard Design Specification

## Layout
- Two-column layout on desktop (main content 8 columns, secondary 4), single column on tablet/mobile with stack ordering.
- Global KPI strip at top featuring four tiles with quick metrics (Utilisation, Active Jobs, Average Response Time, Compliance Alerts).
- Secondary column houses action queue, upcoming approvals, and knowledge tips.

## Modules
1. **Operations Timeline** – Horizontal timeline showcasing upcoming jobs, deadlines, maintenance events; interactive hover tooltips.
2. **Performance Snapshot** – Combined bar/line chart for revenue vs. utilisation; includes filter shelf (Week, Month, Quarter).
3. **Approvals Queue** – Table summarising pending requests with quick approve/decline actions.
4. **Resource Spotlight** – Rotating cards featuring new policies or playbooks.

## Interactions
- Hover on KPI tile reveals secondary metric; clicking opens analytics page anchored to relevant view.
- Modules support collapse/expand to personalise layout; preferences stored per user.
- Drag-and-drop module ordering considered for roadmap (documented as optional).

## Accessibility
- Ensure charts include text summaries describing key insights.
- Keyboard navigation allows focusing modules and performing actions without mouse.

## Responsive Behaviour
- On tablet, KPI tiles convert to 2x2 grid; timeline becomes vertical list.
- On mobile, modules stack with accordion toggles to save space.

## Analytics
- Track module visibility, filter usage, and conversions (e.g., approvals completed) for iterative improvement.
