# Text & Tone Standards

## Voice Principles
- **Assured & supportive:** Communicate expertise and compliance credibility without sounding rigid.
- **Action-oriented:** Lead with verbs that encourage progress ("Review bids", "Complete compliance check").
- **Transparent:** Surface fees, policies, and AI usage clearly to build trust.

## Copy Patterns
- **Hero Messaging:** Pair bold value proposition with zone-aware subtext (e.g., "Trusted providers near Birmingham, curated for regulated industries").
- **Dashboard Insights:** Present metric → insight → recommendation ("Utilisation 82% ↑12% vs last week. Rebalance teams? Start plan").
- **Alerts:** Include severity prefix, action, and deadline ("Compliance Alert: DBS expiring in 3 days. Renew now").
- **Empty States:** Explain why, suggest next steps, provide CTA ("No bids yet. Share your request link or invite providers directly.").
- **Tooltips & Help:** Limit to two sentences; link to resources when more depth required.

## Localisation & Accessibility
- Reserve 30% extra width for translated copy; avoid embedding text in images.
- Provide localisation keys using snake_case (e.g., `hero.cta.explore_services`).
- Ensure screen readers receive context through `aria-labels` and hidden copy (e.g., "Rating: 4.8 out of 5").

## Legal & Compliance Copy
- Document AI assistance disclaimers, consent forms, and GDPR rights with plain language and cross-link to policies.
- Use consistent naming for regulatory artefacts ("DBS Certificate", "Insurance Proof").
