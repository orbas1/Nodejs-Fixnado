# Copywriting Guidelines (Web)

## Tone
- Confident, professional, solution-oriented. Highlight measurable value and safety focus.

## Patterns
- Use action-driven button labels ("Schedule export", "Review request").
- Provide descriptive headlines with supporting subhead.
- Keep paragraphs concise (2â€“3 sentences) and use bullet lists for complex info.

## Error Messages
- Explain issue, cause, and action: "We couldn't load approvals. Refresh or contact support with code #A12."

## Success Messages
- Reinforce achievement and next step: "Report scheduled. We'll email you and your team once it's ready."

## Accessibility
- Avoid idioms, ensure plain language, and include alt text captions.
- Provide tooltips for acronyms and industry-specific terms.
