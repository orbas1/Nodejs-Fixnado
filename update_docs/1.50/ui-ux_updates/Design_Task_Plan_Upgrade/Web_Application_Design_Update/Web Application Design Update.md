# Web Application Design Update Summary

## Objectives
- Align responsive web application with Version 1.50 strategy, delivering cohesive navigation, actionable dashboards, and scalable component system across admin, marketplace, and resource surfaces.
- Improve efficiency for procurement and operations personas by surfacing critical tasks and reducing navigation depth.
- Modernise visual language to align with refreshed brand guidelines and accessibility standards.

## Scope
- Redesign 34 key pages including dashboard, marketplace home, provider detail, resource hub, settings, analytics, and admin panels.
- Update component library (React) with new tokens, states, and documentation.
- Produce detailed logic flows, styling specs, and asset inventories for development handoff.

## Pillars
1. **Information Architecture:** Simplify navigation into global header + contextual dock, restructure sitemap, and provide breadcrumb clarity.
2. **Workflow Optimisation:** Streamline job approval, procurement requests, and reporting exports with guided flows and contextual actions.
3. **Visual Consistency:** Apply unified colour/typography tokens, responsive grid, and accessible spacing across all pages.
4. **Insight Delivery:** Highlight metrics and trends in dashboard modules, enabling at-a-glance decision making.
5. **Scalability:** Document component behaviours for re-use across future modules, supporting white-label theming.

## Deliverables
- High-fidelity mocks with annotations for all priority pages.
- Updated style guide covering tokens, components, CSS/SCSS structure.
- Logic flow diagrams illustrating navigation, data interactions, and error handling.
- Asset library for images, icons, and illustrations with usage guidance.
- QA checklist ensuring accessibility and responsive breakpoints validated.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** IA validation, sitemap update, navigation concepts.
- **Week 2:** Dashboard and marketplace high-fidelity designs.
- **Week 3:** Resource hub, settings, admin modules.
- **Week 4:** Documentation, developer handoff, analytics alignment.
- **Week 5+:** Support implementation, gather feedback, plan v1.51 enhancements.

## Stakeholders
- Product (Marketplace, Admin), Frontend Engineering, Design Systems, Marketing, Support.
- Weekly syncs plus async review via Figma comments and Loom walkthroughs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep:** Maintain prioritised backlog, evaluate trade-offs, and stage lower-priority pages for future release.
- **Performance impact:** Set component budget guidelines and collaborate with engineering on lazy-loading strategies.
- **Content readiness:** Partner with marketing/support to ensure new text/images delivered by Week 3.
