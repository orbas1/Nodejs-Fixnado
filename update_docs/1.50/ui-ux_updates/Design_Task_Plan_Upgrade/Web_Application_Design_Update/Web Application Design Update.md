# Web Application Design Update Summary

## Vision & Pillars
- **Persona-coordinated journeys:** Home, dashboards, and admin workspaces adapt module order and data density for seekers, providers, and governance roles while sharing one component kit.
- **Operational intelligence:** AI nudges, compliance guardrails, and performance analytics are surfaced contextually to reduce manual oversight and shorten resolution cycles.
- **Trust-first commerce:** Every booking, rental, and campaign flow surfaces verification, policy, and consent checkpoints without sacrificing conversion speed.
- **Future-proof theming:** Dark/light support, reduced-motion paths, and scalable token architecture ensure consistency across React, Blade, and native shells.
- **Operational resilience:** Admin consoles integrate deployment status, alarm streams, and DR guidance tied to the infrastructure promotion checklist and backup runbook.

## Deliverables & Artefacts
- **Multi-resolution wireframes:** Desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints for Home, Marketplace Explorer, Campaign Manager, Compliance Centre, and Provider Console, annotated with responsive behaviour.
- **Component & token specs:** Detailed configuration for cards, lists, charts, navigation, and overlays, mapped to CSS/SCSS variables and Storybook tickets.
- **Interaction playbooks:** Micro-interaction guidance (hover, focus, loading, error) for checkout, custom job bidding, dispute mediation, and consent management.
- **Content system:** Copy decks, localisation keys, and tone standards for hero messaging, dashboard insights, and legal prompts.

## Workstreams & Handoff
1. **Experience Architecture** – Finalise information hierarchy, persona switch logic, and navigation states; deliver flow diagrams and sitemap updates to product and engineering (Week 1).
2. **Visual Design** – Produce hi-fi mocks with annotated tokens, dark mode, and motion frames; attach design QA checklist (Week 2).
3. **Prototype & Validation** – Build interactive Figma prototypes covering booking, ads setup, and compliance escalations; run moderated tests and document findings (Week 3).
4. **Implementation Support** – Pair with frontend teams on Blade and React templating, providing redlines, accessible alternatives, and CSS/SCSS snippets (Week 4).

## Success Metrics & Tracking
- **Conversion uplift:** +18% geo-targeted booking conversion and +12% ad click-through (aligned with change log objectives).
- **Operational efficiency:** Reduce compliance overdue rate by 25% and dispute resolution time by 30% through improved dashboards and workflow cues.
- **Adoption signals:** 80% of active providers engage with the new campaign wizard within first month; 70% of users leverage comparison tray.
- **Quality gates:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, localisation readiness for 5 top regions, and analytics instrumentation plan covering core events (search, shortlist, checkout, consent changes).

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Data integrations:** Requires up-to-date availability, compliance documents, and campaign metrics from backend services; mock data defined in dummy dataset spec.
- **Technical alignment:** Ensure new layout tokens align with existing Tailwind/SCSS stacks and do not regress existing pages.
- **Change management:** Communicate updates via release notes, in-app tours, and provider webinars to drive adoption.
