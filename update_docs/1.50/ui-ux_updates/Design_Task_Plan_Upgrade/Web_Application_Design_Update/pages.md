# Page-Level Design Considerations

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Desktop ≥1280px, Tablet 768–1279px, Mobile ≤767px.
- Define layout adjustments per page, ensuring key CTAs remain prominent across breakpoints.

## Accessibility
- Each page includes skip navigation, semantic headings, descriptive titles.
- Provide ARIA landmarks (main, nav, aside) to support screen reader navigation.

## Performance
- Lazy load non-critical modules (charts, secondary lists).
- Implement image preloading for hero sections to avoid layout shift.

## Content Strategy
- Collaborate with marketing/support on copy updates; maintain consistent tone.
- Provide inline definitions for industry terms via tooltips.

## QA Checklist
- Validate layout across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- Test keyboard navigation, focus states, and screen reader announcements.
- Ensure analytics events fire on page load and major interactions.
