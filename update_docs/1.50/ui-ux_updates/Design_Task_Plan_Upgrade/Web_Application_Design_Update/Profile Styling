# Provider Profile Styling Guidelines

## Colour Usage
- Hero background gradient from `color.brand.navy.700` to `color.brand.sky.400` with overlay for readability.
- Section cards use `surface.alt`; badges use semantic colours (certified = teal, warning = amber).

## Typography
- Provider name uses `display-lg`; metrics use `heading-sm`; body copy `body-md`.
- Reviews use italic quotes with citation styling.

## Components
- Tabs highlight active state with underline and background tint.
- Buttons (Request Quote, Save) follow primary/secondary button styles.
- Review list includes star rating component and text snippet.

## Responsive Behaviour
- On tablet/mobile hero condenses to stacked layout, actions become sticky bottom bar.
- Cards reorder to prioritise contact info and services.

## Accessibility
- Provide keyboard navigation for tabs, focus states on quick action buttons.
- Ratings include textual value and total review count.
