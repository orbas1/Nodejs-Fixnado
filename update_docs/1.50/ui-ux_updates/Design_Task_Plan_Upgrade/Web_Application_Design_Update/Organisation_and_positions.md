# Layout Organisation & Positioning (Web)

## Grid System
- 12-column grid, 80px margins on desktop, 24px gutter. Tablet uses 8 columns, mobile 4 columns.

## Header & Hero
- Header fixed at top with 72px height; hero sections align to grid with CTA buttons aligned left.

## Content Sections
- Use alternating background to define sections; maintain 96px spacing between major sections on desktop.
- Align text blocks left for readability; centre hero CTA only when accompanied by symmetrical imagery.

## Sidebars
- Dashboard uses right sidebar for action queue with fixed width 320px; collapses to accordion on mobile.

## Tables & Cards
- Tables full-width with sticky header; actions aligned right. Cards arranged in responsive masonry layout.

## Footer
- Structured into four columns (Products, Company, Resources, Contact) collapsing to accordion on mobile.

## Alignment Rules
- Ensure icons, text, and buttons align vertically across sections; use baseline grid to maintain rhythm.
