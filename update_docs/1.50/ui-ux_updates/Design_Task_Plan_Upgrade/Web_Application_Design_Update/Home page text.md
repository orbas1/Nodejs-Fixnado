- **Rotating Subheadlines:**
  - "Book vetted trades, rentals, and facility teams with AI assistance."
  - "Launch targeted campaigns to grow your service footprint." (provider persona)
  - "Track compliance and delivery from a single, trusted dashboard."

- **Resource Spotlight:** Provide sentence on latest release note or guide with "Read update" link.
