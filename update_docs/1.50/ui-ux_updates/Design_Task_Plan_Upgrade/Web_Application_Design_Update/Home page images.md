# Home Page Imagery Plan

## Hero Image
- Industrial jobsite photo with operators and equipment; ensure inclusive representation.
- Provide versions: Desktop 2000x900, Tablet 1400x800, Mobile 900x900.
- Apply gradient overlay for text legibility (navy â†’ sky blue).

## Supporting Photography
- Benefit cards use iconography rather than photos to reduce load.
- Testimonials include grayscale portraits at 120x120px with accessible alt text.
- Resource CTA uses vector illustration consistent with brand style.

## Optimisation
- Export as WebP with fallback JPEG; limit hero to <250kb, other assets <80kb.
- Provide alt text and captions for screen readers.
- Confirm licensing and documentation for each asset.
