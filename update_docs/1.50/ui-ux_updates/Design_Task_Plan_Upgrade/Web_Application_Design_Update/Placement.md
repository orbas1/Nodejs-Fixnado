# Component Placement Guidelines

## Above the Fold
- Hero headings, primary CTA, critical metrics appear within first 700px vertically.
- Avoid stacking more than two major CTAs above the fold to reduce cognitive load.

## Sidebars
- Use right sidebar for actionable insights (approvals, notifications). Ensure consistent width (320px) and sticky behaviour.

## Modals & Drawers
- Place modals centered with max width 640px; drawers slide from right for secondary tasks (filters, details).
- Maintain safe area margins on smaller screens.

## Charts & Tables
- Charts should align left with descriptive text; tables follow, providing drill-down context.
- Provide "View details" CTA positioned immediately after summary text.

## Mobile Considerations
- Stack components vertically; place CTAs near top and bottom for convenience.
- Provide sticky action bars when context requires immediate action (e.g., approval forms).
