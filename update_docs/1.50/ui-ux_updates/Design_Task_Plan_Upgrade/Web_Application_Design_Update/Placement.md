# Placement Rules

- Keep primary CTAs above the fold with supporting trust indicators (ratings, compliance badges).
- Place AI insight drawer trigger consistently on right edge to align with context panel location.
- Ensure filters and search remain visible via sticky behaviour to prevent user disorientation.
- Position compliance alerts near affected actions (e.g., blocking banner above "Accept job").
- Locate collaboration tools (chat, call, share) within job detail header for quick access.
- Place analytics export and settings icons top-right of each widget to maintain discoverability.
- Reserve bottom of pages for secondary actions (download, print) and link to resources.
