# Placement Rules

- Keep primary CTAs above the fold with supportive context and trust signals.
- Locate AI insights consistently on the right for quick glance.
- Ensure filters remain visible when scrolling via sticky positioning.
- Place compliance alerts adjacent to actions they impact.
- Use modals sparingly; prefer slide-over panels for multi-step tasks.
