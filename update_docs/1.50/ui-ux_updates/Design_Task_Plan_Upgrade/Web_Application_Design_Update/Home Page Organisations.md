## Layout Principles
- Maintain 80px vertical spacing between sections; adjust to 48px on tablet/mobile.
- Alternating background colours to create visual rhythm (white vs. `surface.alt`).
- Use container width 1200px with 24px gutters.

## Accessibility
- Ensure hero text meets contrast ratio; provide alt text for imagery.
- Buttons accessible via keyboard, focus ring visible.

## Personalisation
- Hero message dynamic based on referral parameter (e.g., industry-specific copy).
- Marketplace preview curated by region/time.
