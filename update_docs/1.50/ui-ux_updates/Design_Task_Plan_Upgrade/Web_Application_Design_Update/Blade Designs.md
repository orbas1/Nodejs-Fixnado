# Blade Template Designs

- **Layout Strategy:** Master blade defines global shell with slots for top nav, side rail, content, footer.
- **Reusable Partials:** Breadcrumbs, alerts, modals, pagination, action bars.
- **Conditional Blocks:** Persona-based modules loaded via blade directives.
- **Theme Support:** Light/dark toggles implemented through Blade components with tailwind classes.
- **Performance:** Lazy-load heavy sections, use stacks for scripts/styles injection.
