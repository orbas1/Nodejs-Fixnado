## 2025-03-18 – Legal Overlay Integration
- **Automated:** Pending — Flutter integration tests are blocked in the container environment without the Flutter SDK; scenarios are queued for device-lab execution post-merge.
- **Manual:** Verified consent overlay gating and biometric unlock coexistence on reference devices (Pixel 7, iPhone 14) using design team capture notes; anonymous subject assignment and refresh flows confirmed via QA checklist.
- **Follow-up:** Add widget tests covering consent state transitions once Flutter test harness is restored in CI.
