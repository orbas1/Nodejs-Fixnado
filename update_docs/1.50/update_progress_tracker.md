> **Notes:**
> - Baseline percentages reflect current readiness before new execution; security work has marginal progress from prior audits, but major remediations remain open.
> - API gateway hardening (rate limiting, CORS enforcement, health telemetry) is live in staging, lifting the security, integration, and production readiness indicators for Task 1.
> - Personally identifiable information now persists using AES-256-GCM encryption with hashed lookup columns and automated migrations, further increasing Task 1 security, functionality, and production confidence scores.
> - RBAC matrices, signed session cookies, consent logging APIs, and scam detection telemetry are implemented, materially raising Task 1 completion, integration, and production confidence metrics.
> - Vault-backed secret hydration, cookie rotation hardening, and the new consent/session token regression suites increased Task 1 security, error-free, and production indicators after targeted Vitest coverage.
> - Overall Level % values are the rounded averages of the six tracked dimensions per task.
> - Tracker will be updated weekly following milestone reviews and evidence collection.

## Design Progress Addendum
The design workstream tracks readiness using the detailed metrics captured in `Design_update_progress_tracker.md`. Current baseline scores are summarised below to align cross-functional expectations.

| D5 | Mobile Parity & Component Adaptation | 18 | 20 | 18 | 20 | 18 | 18 | 24 | 24 | 20 | 18 | 24 | 34 | 18 | 18 | 20 | 20 |
| D6 | Design QA, Documentation & Handover | 15 | 18 | 16 | 18 | 16 | 16 | 20 | 20 | 18 | 16 | 20 | 32 | 16 | 16 | 18 | 18 |

**Interpretation:**
- Progress remains early-stage; token work shows the highest traction due to preliminary palette consolidation and accessibility research.
- Navigation and template efforts will raise organisational and usability scores once usability testing and partial builds commence.
- Security and compliance grades will improve as privacy prompts, consent UX, and secure messaging components are incorporated into final artefacts.
