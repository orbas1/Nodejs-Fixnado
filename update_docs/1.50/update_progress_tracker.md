> **Notes:**
> - Baseline percentages reflect current readiness before new execution; security work has marginal progress from prior audits, but major remediations remain open.
> - API gateway hardening (rate limiting, CORS enforcement, health telemetry) is live in staging, lifting the security, integration, and production readiness indicators for Task 1.
> - Personally identifiable information now persists using AES-256-GCM encryption with hashed lookup columns and automated migrations, further increasing Task 1 security, functionality, and production confidence scores.
> - Provider dashboard services were rebuilt with production RBAC, trust scoring, and audit-friendly summaries; lint remains clean and integration confidence continues to climb as downstream dashboards consume the richer payloads.
> - Session handling now issues signed JWT access tokens with httpOnly cookie delivery for web clients and secure storage + biometric gates for Flutter, keeping Task 1 security, completion, integration, and production readiness metrics elevated.
> - Consent management now captures granular ledger entries, surfaces banner/overlay flows, and exposes REST endpoints plus tests, pushing Task 1 completion to 78% with measurable gains in integration, functionality, and error-free scores.
> - Scam detection heuristics with AI enrichment and Opsgenie escalations are wired into booking creation, further improving Task 1 security posture and production readiness while supplying actionable telemetry to analytics.
> - RBAC policy matrix, navigation blueprint, and access-control refactor are complete, raising Task 1 completion, integration, and production scores while unlocking downstream compliance, payments, and IA deliverables.
> - Overall readiness for Task 1 sits at 80% with security controls, consent enforcement, and risk telemetry now exercised end-to-end across web and mobile channels.
> - Overall Level % values are the rounded averages of the six tracked dimensions per task.
> - Tracker will be updated weekly following milestone reviews and evidence collection.

## Design Progress Addendum
The design workstream tracks readiness using the detailed metrics captured in `Design_update_progress_tracker.md`. Current baseline scores are summarised below to align cross-functional expectations.

**Interpretation:**
- Progress remains early-stage; token work shows the highest traction due to consolidated palette, typography, and state documentation.
- Navigation and template efforts will raise organisational and usability scores once usability testing and partial builds commence.
- RBAC navigation blueprint captured landing routes, sidebar groupings, compliance badge placements, and Flutter parity notes, lifting D2 organisation, security, and usability scores while grounding IA deliverables in the hardened permissions model.
- Security and compliance grades will improve as privacy prompts, consent UX, and secure messaging components are incorporated into final artefacts.
- Token system metrics increased after landing the consent banner styles, ledger receipts, and responsive overlays used across web and mobile security entry points.
- Mobile adaptation scores rose thanks to the Flutter consent overlay, policy cards, refreshed typography applied to legal modals, and parity checklists validated with engineering.
