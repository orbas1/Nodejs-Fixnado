> **Notes:**
> - Baseline percentages reflect current readiness before new execution; security work has marginal progress from prior audits, but major remediations remain open.
> - API gateway hardening (rate limiting, CORS enforcement, health telemetry) is live in staging, lifting the security, integration, and production readiness indicators for Task 1.
> - Personally identifiable information now persists using AES-256-GCM encryption with hashed lookup columns and automated migrations, further increasing Task 1 security, functionality, and production confidence scores.
> - Provider dashboard services were rebuilt with production RBAC, trust scoring, and audit-friendly summaries; lint remains clean and integration confidence continues to climb as downstream dashboards consume the richer payloads.
> - Session handling now issues signed JWT access tokens with httpOnly cookie delivery for web clients and secure storage + biometric gates for Flutter, keeping Task 1 security, completion, integration, and production readiness metrics elevated.
> - Consent management now captures granular ledger entries, surfaces banner/overlay flows, and exposes REST endpoints plus tests, pushing Task 1 completion to 78% with measurable gains in integration, functionality, and error-free scores.
> - Scam detection heuristics with AI enrichment and Opsgenie escalations are wired into booking creation, further improving Task 1 security posture and production readiness while supplying actionable telemetry to analytics.
> - Compliance data governance migration introduced the multi-region `Region` catalogue, GDPR request ledger, finance/message/storefront history tables, and automated retention job, propelling Task 2 security and integration readiness into production territory.
> - Backend and React compliance portals now expose submission, filtering, export, and status management flows with RBAC enforcement; Flutter profile navigation embeds the Riverpod-driven Data Requests screen, increasing Task 2 completion, functionality, and usability scores.
> - Warehouse CDC exports now run on a scheduled service with Secrets Manager credential rotation, TLS enforcement, and operator consoles across React and Flutter, significantly raising Task 2 integration, functionality, and production readiness.
> - Compliance documentation and design artefacts for the warehouse operations console, DPIA guidance, and mobile parity are now published, lifting Task 2 completion, integration, and production readiness metrics to 79% overall as operator teams receive end-to-end support.
> - RBAC policy matrix, navigation blueprint, and access-control refactor are complete, raising Task 1 completion, integration, and production scores while unlocking downstream compliance, payments, and IA deliverables.
> - Policy middleware now protects every privileged route, writes structured audit trail entries, and publishes Vitest coverage for policy allow/deny flows, lifting Task 1 security, integration, and error-free readiness.
> - Overall readiness for Task 1 sits at 89% with security controls, consent enforcement, risk telemetry, policy auditing, and vault-backed secrets exercised end-to-end across web and mobile channels.
> - Secrets management automation now sources credentials from AWS Secrets Manager with boot-time validation, raising security, error-free, and production readiness scores while the Postgres bootstrap script standardises least-privilege provisioning for new regions.
> - Payments orchestration now runs through dedicated `/api/finance` controllers, migrations, and a finance webhook worker; the React and Flutter dashboards consume the new endpoints, lifting Task 3 completion, integration, and production readiness into the mid-50s.
> - Finance orchestration evidence now includes seeded webhook replay fixtures, payout scheduling monitors, and staged finance dashboards across React and Flutter, pushing Task 3 security, integration, and production readiness into the mid-60s while highlighting remaining export/report automation work.
> - Overall Level % values are the rounded averages of the six tracked dimensions per task.
> - Tracker will be updated weekly following milestone reviews and evidence collection.

**Interpretation:**
- Progress remains early-stage; token work shows the highest traction due to consolidated palette, typography, and state documentation.
- Navigation and template efforts will raise organisational and usability scores once usability testing and partial builds commence.
- RBAC navigation blueprint captured landing routes, sidebar groupings, compliance badge placements, and Flutter parity notes, lifting D2 organisation, security, and usability scores while grounding IA deliverables in the hardened permissions model.
- Policy audit chips and denial copy decks were added to navigation templates, boosting D2 security, compliance, and usability grades while clarifying middleware feedback for both web and Flutter shells.
- Security and compliance grades will improve as privacy prompts, consent UX, and secure messaging components are incorporated into final artefacts.
- Token system metrics increased after landing the consent banner styles, ledger receipts, and responsive overlays used across web and mobile security entry points.
- Mobile adaptation scores rose thanks to the Flutter consent overlay, policy cards, refreshed typography applied to legal modals, and parity checklists validated with engineering.
- Finance orchestration dashboards and escrow timeline templates now include SLA breach, retry, and manual intervention states, boosting D3 quality, organisation, functionality, and accuracy grades with concrete artefacts tied to the new backend telemetry.
- Flutter finance dashboard parity specifications covering KPI ribbons, dispute funnels, payout readiness, and regulatory alerts raised D5 quality, organisation, compliance, security, and overall readiness while documenting gesture/empty states for mobile operators.
