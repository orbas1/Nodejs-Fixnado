# Design Update Task List – Version 1.50

## Task 1 – Consolidate Experience Architecture
- [x] Audit existing mobile and web flows against **Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md** and **Logic_Flow_map.md** artefacts (synthesised into the platform architecture blueprint and ops cockpit overlays).
- [x] Produce updated information architecture diagrams for provider, user, admin, and platform-ops personas (documented within the architecture blueprint and design change log).
- [ ] Validate navigation touchpoints (dashboards, menus, breadcrumbs) with product stakeholders.
- [x] Document cross-platform alignment notes detailing feature parity and divergence rationale (see "Cross-Channel Experience Alignment" section of the architecture blueprint).
- [ ] Publish sitemap and journey maps to central design repository for cross-team access.

## Task 2 – Finalise Visual System & Tokens
- [ ] Harmonise colour tokens and gradients from mobile and web palettes, ensuring contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1.
- [ ] Update typography scale and responsive behaviour, including localisation fallbacks.
- [ ] Define component spacing, elevation, and iconography guidelines spanning cards, forms, and action bars.
- [ ] Export tokens to engineering consumable formats (JSON, CSS variables, Flutter styles).
- [ ] Create Storybook/Tailwind references and Blade snippets to accelerate implementation.

## Task 3 – Prototype & Validate Core Journeys
- [ ] Build interactive Figma prototypes for booking, campaign setup, compliance escalation, and rental management flows.
- [ ] Source dummy data sets and imagery aligned with **Dummy_Data_Requirements.md** and imagery libraries.
- [ ] Conduct moderated usability testing with provider and user cohorts; capture qualitative and quantitative findings.
- [ ] Run accessibility audits focusing on keyboard navigation, focus order, and reduced-motion states.
- [ ] Iterate prototypes incorporating usability and accessibility feedback.
- [ ] Produce final UX research report and circulate decisions to stakeholders.

## Task 4 – Implementation Support & QA
- [x] Harden design-support tooling with ESLint 9 flat configs, PropTypes coverage, and dependency audit CI to keep token, copy, and accessibility guardrails intact across repos.
- [ ] Host design-engineering handoff sessions covering component specs, motion cues, and content guidelines.
- [ ] Provide redlines and responsive behaviour annotations for complex screens and dashboards.
- [ ] Support Storybook/Flutter widget implementation with asynchronous reviews and recorded Loom walkthroughs.
- [ ] Execute design QA checklist across staging builds, logging issues in the release tracker.
- [ ] Prepare release communications (in-app tours, webinars, release notes) in partnership with product marketing.
