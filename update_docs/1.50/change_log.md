# Version 1.50 Update Change Log

## 2025-02-20 â€“ API Gateway Hardening Baseline
- Introduced environment-driven request limiting, trusted proxy support, and consented origin enforcement for the Fixnado API gateway to close subtask 4 of the Security & Secrets Hardening epic.
- Added `/healthz` diagnostics returning uptime, timestamp, and database latency to support load balancers and observability monitors.
- Documented the operational parameters across backend, environment, and release artefacts to keep the milestone trackers aligned with the implemented gateway protections.

## Historical Reference
- Removed all provider phone app artifacts (documentation, evaluations, tests, and UI assets) from the update package to reflect the retirement of the provider mobile experience.
