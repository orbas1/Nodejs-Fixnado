# Test Plan Addendum â€“ Version 1.50

## Gateway Hardening Regression Coverage
- **Automated:** Added `tests/securityGateway.test.js` to verify health telemetry, origin rejection, and rate limit enforcement within Vitest. The suite consumes in-memory SQLite to keep the pipeline hermetic.
- **Manual:** Staging checklist updated to include cURL validation of `/healthz`, cross-origin browser probe from an allowed and disallowed domain, and burst testing from load-generator IP pools.
- **Monitoring Hooks:** Health endpoint output is wired into observability dashboards; failures must raise alerts through existing Slack webhook integrations.

## PII Encryption Validation
- **Automated:** Introduced `tests/piiEncryption.test.js` to confirm AES-256-GCM storage, hashed email lookups, and company contact redaction operate end-to-end under Vitest.
- **Manual:** Run migration dry-runs in staging with dummy keys before promoting production rotations; verify seeded admin accounts remain accessible post-migration.
- **Monitoring Hooks:** Add metrics/alerts tracking failed decryptions or hash mismatches; integrate with security incident response runbooks.
