# Front-End Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- Routing covers marketing pages, auth, feed, services, search, and admin dashboards, but nearly every page is static. Forms (`Login`, `Register`, `CompanyRegister`) have no submission handlers or API calls, so authentication and onboarding are non-functional.
- Components like `LiveFeed`, `MarketplaceShowcase`, and `ServiceZones` render mock data baked into the bundle. Without data fetching hooks or integration with the backend, the UI cannot surface real-time content or respond to user actions.
- Admin dashboard page (`AdminDashboard.jsx`) is disconnected from backend metrics. It uses hard-coded charts and counts, so enterprise operators cannot actually monitor escrow/disputes.

## Usability
- There is no global loading/error state management. If API calls are added later, the current architecture lacks spinners, skeletons, or toast notifications to guide users.
- Accessibility gaps: key interactive elements (buttons styled as divs, icon-only buttons) are missing ARIA labels and focus states. Forms do not associate labels with inputs using `htmlFor`, hurting screen-reader usability.
- Responsiveness is partially handled via Tailwind, but complex layouts (e.g., `OperationalBlueprint`, `EnterpriseStack`) rely on large grids that break on small screens due to fixed widths and missing overflow handling.

## Errors
- Without form validation or client-side guards, users can submit empty credentials or malformed company data; the forms never surface errors because no validation state exists.
- There is no 404/500 route handling; invalid URLs render a blank page because `Routes` lacks a catch-all. This leads to poor error recovery and discoverability.
- The build has no runtime error boundary. A single React exception will crash the app without user-facing messaging or graceful fallback.

## Integration
- API integration is nonexistent. `axios` is listed as a dependency but never imported, and there are no hooks/services to talk to the backend. Token storage, refresh flows, and request tracing are all unimplemented.
- Authentication state is not persisted. The header renders navigation links regardless of auth, and protected routes (Profile, Admin Dashboard) do not check permissions before rendering.
- There is no integration with analytics, logging, or A/B testing platforms despite enterprise marketing claims. Even simple integrations like sending login events to a telemetry service are missing.

## Security
- Forms post sensitive data (email/password) without using controlled components or client-side masking. There is no CSRF mitigation strategy outlined for future API calls.
- Admin pages live on the public bundle without feature gating. Anyone can navigate to `/admin/dashboard` and view privileged UI components because no auth guard exists client-side.
- Third-party embeds or iframes are absent, but the build configuration lacks CSP guidance (`meta` tags or helmet equivalents), leaving future integrations at risk if content is embedded unsafely.

## Alignment
- UI copy promises secure login with 2FA and real-time escrow dashboards, yet the components only toggle checkboxes or show static numbers. The implementation does not align with the product vision communicated in marketing sections.
- The Explorer/Marketplace modules spotlight curated data, but there is no search integration or personalization, so the experience falls short of “enterprise velocity” narratives elsewhere.
- Lack of state synchronization with the mobile app or backend means cross-platform continuity (e.g., starting a purchase on web and finishing on mobile) is impossible today.
