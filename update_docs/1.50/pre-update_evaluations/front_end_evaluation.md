# Front-End Pre-Update Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- **High – Feature parity gaps**: Regional marketplace toggles exist only as placeholders; there are no API calls or feature-flag bindings to surface region-specific catalogues. Compliance review dashboards render skeleton states without data, blocking stakeholder demos.
- **High – Real-time experience limitations**: Live feeds rely on 30s polling. Product expects near-real-time updates for moderation status and logistics tracking, which requires WebSocket or SSE integration with reconnection handling.
- **Medium – Admin workflow gaps**: Admin routes render stub components with unbound forms, preventing compliance staff from approving disputes or escalations. Form logic and backend orchestration need to be implemented end-to-end.
- **Medium – Internationalisation coverage**: New locales (fr-FR, de-DE) promised for 1.50 are absent from the i18n bundle. Hard-coded copy remains in English, leading to translation debt at launch.
- **Low – Performance instrumentation**: There is no Core Web Vitals reporting or user timing instrumentation. Without these hooks product analytics cannot validate performance targets.
- **Low – Router duplication indicates regressions**: `src/App.jsx` declares `/provider/storefront` and `/enterprise/panel` twice, once guarded and once open. The duplicates mask auth bugs and will confuse QA about intended access control.
- **Low – Entry shell missing resiliency**: `src/main.jsx` bootstraps providers directly inside `React.StrictMode` without any suspense-aware error boundary or hydration guard. A single rejected lazy import leaves the entire shell blank instead of surfacing recovery UI.

## Usability
- **High – Navigation overload**: The primary header duplicates Marketplace, Services, and Compliance tabs, and the new analytics entry adds another layer. Consolidate into a contextual mega-menu and adopt breadcrumbs for admin flows.
- **Medium – Accessibility non-compliance**: Carousel, modal, and tooltip components lack keyboard traps, focus outlines, and ARIA labelling. Automated axe scans surface >30 violations. Integrate eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and build regression tests.
- **Medium – Responsive layout issues**: Tablet breakpoints (768–1024px) display overlapping CTAs and truncated hero copy. Marketing campaigns will fail QA on these devices without redesigning Tailwind grid definitions.
- **Medium – Form ergonomics**: Validation feedback is generic (“Something went wrong”). Introduce field-level validation messages and inline guidance for compliance forms.
- **Low – Content governance**: Marketing copy still references “1.0 beta”. Update messaging, hero assets, and testimonials to match the 1.50 positioning deck.
- **Low – Dashboard selection friction**: `src/pages/DashboardHub.jsx` floods the layout with duplicated “Enter” and “View capabilities” actions, even for personas without access, creating confusion during enterprise demos. Add clear disabled states and consolidate CTAs.

## Errors
- **High – Silent API failures**: API clients swallow JSON parsing errors and return empty data structures, leaving the UI in blank states. Add error boundaries, typed error responses, and user-facing fallback messages.
- **Medium – State management drift**: Redux slices and Zustand stores coexist without clear ownership. Derived data gets out of sync, causing inconsistent UI states during rapid navigation. Define a consolidation plan and adopt a single state layer per domain.
- **Medium – Testing gaps**: Vitest coverage remains focused on legacy pages. New analytics widgets, compliance forms, and region toggles lack tests, so regressions will go undetected.
- **Medium – Root-level error handling absent**: There is no `ErrorBoundary` wrapping `<App />` in `src/main.jsx`, so route loader exceptions bubble to the console and the UI freezes without a fallback. We need a shared boundary and toast-level surfacing for enterprise reliability.
- **Low – Build-time warnings**: Vite emits warnings for large bundle sizes and unused environment variables. Address them to keep CI logs actionable.
- **Low – Error logging**: There is no client-side error logging integration (Sentry/DataDog). Production crashes cannot be triaged quickly without instrumentation.
- **Low – Routing fallbacks missing**: `src/App.jsx` lacks a catch-all `<Route>` for unknown paths. Navigating to stale links yields blank pages rather than redirecting users, complicating support diagnostics.

## Integration
- **High – API contract mismatches**: Frontend expects camelCase fields while backend delivers snake_case. Without normalisation helpers, data bindings break and require manual mapping in each component.
- **Medium – Analytics instrumentation**: Segment/Amplitude stubs exist but are not initialised. Marketing lacks funnel visibility. Wire up analytics providers with consent management.
- **Medium – Design system reuse**: Shared components are duplicated across React and Flutter projects. Establish a shared package for typography, colour tokens, and feature flag utilities to ensure parity.
- **Medium – Feature flagging**: Frontend reads flags via hardcoded environment variables, preventing runtime toggles or phased rollouts. Integrate with LaunchDarkly or a custom remote config endpoint.
- **Low – External services**: Map and geocoding integrations rely on deprecated API keys. Update to current provider SDKs and enforce usage quotas to avoid outages.
- **Low – Toggle cohorts unstable**: `src/providers/FeatureToggleProvider.jsx` seeds rollout cohorts with `Math.random()` on every browser without stable identifiers, so users bounce between treatment and control during the same session.

## Security
- **High – Token handling risk**: Access and refresh tokens persist in `localStorage`, exposing them to XSS. Transition to secure cookies or WebCrypto-backed storage with short-lived tokens.
- **Medium – Input validation gaps**: Forms perform minimal sanitisation, allowing HTML injection that could propagate stored XSS to other users. Integrate schema validators (Zod/Yup) and escape output consistently.
- **Medium – Dependency hygiene**: Vite dev server exposes stack traces and environment variables in the console. Ensure production builds strip debugging output and restrict `window.__APP_CONFIG__` to non-sensitive data.
- **Medium – Feature toggle cache exposure**: `src/providers/FeatureToggleProvider.jsx` stores raw toggle payloads in `sessionStorage` without encryption or scoping, so any injected script can enumerate unreleased features and flip cohorts.
- **Low – CSP/headers**: There is no documented Content Security Policy or security header configuration for the frontend hosting. Define recommended settings with Ops to protect against clickjacking and data exfiltration.
- **Low – Secrets in builds**: Build scripts embed API keys in the bundle for staging environments. Move secrets to server-side proxies or runtime configuration endpoints.
- **Low – Session hook leaks**: `src/hooks/useSession.js` rehydrates tokens straight from `localStorage` and exposes them to any script with DOM access; there is no masking or rotation support for compromised sessions.

## Alignment
- **High – Brand and messaging**: The UI still reflects the 1.00 brand direction. Refresh the design system assets, hero imagery, and messaging per the 1.50 go-to-market plan.
- **Medium – Cross-platform parity**: Feature logic is duplicated between web and mobile. Establish shared business logic packages for analytics events, feature flags, and pricing helpers to reduce divergence.
- **Medium – Performance OKRs**: Lighthouse scores exceed the TTI budget (>3s) on mid-tier hardware. Implement bundle splitting, image optimisation, and lazy loading to meet OKRs.
- **Low – Compliance readiness**: Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) is a contractual requirement for enterprise customers. Formalise an accessibility remediation plan tied to the release timeline.
- **Low – Support tooling**: Customer support expects to triage sessions via integrated logging and replay. Evaluate FullStory or LogRocket integrations while respecting privacy constraints.
- **Low – Entry-point modernisation**: `src/main.jsx` still relies on `ReactDOM.createRoot` without suspense-enabled data providers or hydration guards. Server-driven experiments planned for 1.50 will need an async entry strategy and error boundaries at the root.
