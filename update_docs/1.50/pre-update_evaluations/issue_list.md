# Issue List – Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

1. Backend lacks core transactional workflows, business rule enforcement, and consistent error handling, blocking marketplace fulfillment.
2. Backend security controls are inadequate due to hard-coded secrets, weak auth/session management, and absent rate limiting.
3. Database schema omits critical domain tables, enforces no referential integrity, and uses imprecise monetary fields.
4. Operational database tooling is missing, with no migrations, seed data, or audit logging to support reproducible environments.
5. Dependency management is outdated and unscanned, with no shared configuration, CI enforcement, or observability tooling across stacks.
6. React frontend is static, with non-functional forms, missing API integration, and poor accessibility/responsiveness.
7. Frontend lacks error boundaries, protected routes, and state management, preventing resilient enterprise UX.
8. Flutter user app is non-functional, lacking API integration, validation, secure storage, and offline/error handling.
9. Cross-platform alignment is broken—no shared models, configuration, or security posture—preventing coordinated releases.
