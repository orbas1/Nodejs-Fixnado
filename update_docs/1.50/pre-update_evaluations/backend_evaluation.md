# Backend Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- API surface is still minimal and read-heavy. Core job workflows such as creating posts, updating orders, dispute resolution, escrow release, or marketplace inventory management are missing entirely, so end-to-end fulfillment cannot happen inside the service. The existing controllers only expose registration/login, simple service CRUD (create/list), feed snapshots, and a thin admin metrics endpoint. Without mutation routes for posts, disputes, or marketplace items, the product goals described across the other deliverables cannot be met.
- Business rules are shallow. For example, `purchaseService` blindly funds an order and escrow in a single call without verifying provider availability, service ownership, buyer balance, or double funding (`status` is forced to `funded` regardless of previous state). No pricing validation occurs between the incoming payload and stored service price, which allows clients to underpay.
- Registration is not aligned with the front-end’s expectations around multi-factor setup; the UI surfaces email and app 2FA toggles but the backend only stores boolean columns without an activation flow or secret provisioning. There is also no onboarding logic for provider/company records beyond a single optional create.

## Usability
- Error responses are inconsistent and developer-unfriendly. Validation failures return arrays from `express-validator`, while authentication errors return `{ message }` objects and server errors always return a generic 500. There is no error code taxonomy or localization, so clients must perform brittle string matching.
- Pagination and filtering primitives are absent. List endpoints (`/services`, `/feed/live`, `/feed/marketplace`) return hard-coded limits (25 or 50 records) with no cursors or page parameters, which will break UI infinite scroll patterns and degrade UX once data grows.
- Lacks health/diagnostic endpoints beyond `/` returning a static JSON. There is no readiness check to ensure Sequelize has connected, making operational usability weak.

## Errors & Stability
- Database interactions are not wrapped in transactions even where atomicity is required. In `register`, if `Company.create` fails after `User.create` succeeds the user is left in a half-created state. Similarly `purchaseService` creates an order and escrow sequentially; if escrow creation fails the order remains funded without escrow funds. No compensating clean-up is attempted.
- Controllers assume all async calls succeed; when Sequelize throws (e.g., due to constraint violations) the `errorHandler` logs the full error to stdout and always masks details with a 500. There is no structured logging, correlation IDs, or severity levels.
- Input sanitization is minimal. Rich-text fields like `description` are passed directly to the database with no HTML/JS filtering, opening the risk of stored XSS when data is rendered elsewhere.

## Integration
- Authentication middleware only looks for a `Bearer` token in the Authorization header and does not support cookie-based auth, refresh tokens, or session revocation. Downstream integrations (mobile/web) therefore cannot rely on long-lived sessions. There is no integration with email services for verification or password resets despite being referenced in UX copy.
- External service integrations (payments, notifications, scheduling) are not stubbed. Escrow funding is marked as completed without calling any payment gateway, so integrating with a real escrow processor will require significant rework to introduce async workflows and state machines.
- Admin dashboard route (`/admin/dashboard`) is restricted to `company` accounts even though actual administrators would likely have a dedicated role. There is no RBAC integration or audit trail to plug into enterprise systems.

## Security
- JWT secret defaults to `change_this_secret` and is checked into the repository, encouraging insecure deployments. There is no rotation, key management, or algorithm hardening.
- Password hashing uses `bcrypt` with `SALT_ROUNDS=10`, which is acceptable, but there is no password reset flow, login throttling, IP rate limiting, or suspicious-activity logging, leaving brute force attacks unchecked. Helmet is enabled, yet CORS is wide open with default settings.
- Sequelize models define foreign keys but do not enforce referential integrity at the database level (no explicit `references`/`onDelete`), making it trivial to orphan rows. Input validation only checks presence/type; there is no protection against enumeration (e.g., guessing UUIDs) or business rule validation (e.g., ensuring `price` is positive).

## Alignment
- The API design does not align with the enterprise-grade narrative in the frontend: there are no endpoints for workflow automation, SLA management, or analytics. Feature flags implied by UI components (e.g., marketplace zones, executive dashboards) lack supporting routes/models.
- Mobile and web clients expect richer profile data (2FA toggles, marketplace showcases), but `/auth/me` only returns raw Sequelize user records without formatting, localization, or nested provider/company data beyond a simple include.
- The lack of provider onboarding, escrow lifecycle controls, and dispute mediation endpoints means the backend cannot support the cross-platform experiences described elsewhere, creating a significant alignment gap for the 1.50 update.
