# Fix Suggestions – Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

1. **Backend Remediation and Security Hardening**
   1. Implement full marketplace workflows (service purchase lifecycle, dispute resolution, provider onboarding) with transactional safeguards and domain validation, ensuring escrow states, pricing, and availability checks remain consistent.
   2. Standardize API error handling with structured responses, correlation IDs, and health/readiness probes; introduce pagination, filtering, and rate limiting middleware to stabilize client interactions.
   3. Replace hard-coded secrets with environment-managed credentials, tighten CORS, introduce MFA provisioning endpoints, and add JWT rotation, refresh tokens, and admin role separation to align with enterprise security requirements.

2. **Data Layer Governance and Observability**
   1. Define migrations and rollback strategies covering existing schema plus new domain tables (notifications, analytics, workflow automation) while introducing seed data for QA scenarios.
   2. Enforce referential integrity, uniqueness constraints, lifecycle timestamps, and precise monetary column definitions; add soft-delete/audit columns and structured logging of critical actions.
   3. Configure database connectivity for managed environments (SSL, read replicas, secrets rotation) and integrate schema versioning with CI/CD to maintain reproducibility.

3. **Dependency, CI, and Tooling Modernization**
   1. Audit and upgrade backend, frontend, and Flutter dependencies to supported versions; introduce automated vulnerability scanning (npm audit, Snyk, `flutter pub outdated`) and lockfile enforcement in CI.
   2. Establish shared configuration management (12-factor env handling, secret stores) and cross-stack code generation or schema-sharing tooling to keep DTOs aligned.
   3. Add observability foundations—centralized logging, metrics, tracing, and feature flag frameworks—along with unit/integration testing harnesses across services.

4. **Front-End Functionalization and UX Improvements**
   1. Wire forms to backend APIs with validation, optimistic updates, and meaningful feedback; implement global state management (Redux/RTK or React Query) and error boundaries.
   2. Replace mock data with reusable data-fetching hooks, secure token storage, and protected routes, ensuring admin dashboards and feeds reflect live backend data.
   3. Address accessibility/responsiveness by enforcing semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, responsive grid patterns, and incorporating design system components shared with mobile.

5. **Mobile App Enablement and Parity**
   1. Introduce repository/service layers for API access, secure credential storage (Keychain/Keystore via `flutter_secure_storage`), and state management (Bloc/Provider) to operationalize login, feeds, and escrow flows.
   2. Add form controllers, validation, error messaging, and offline caching/retry strategies to maintain usability under poor connectivity.
   3. Integrate analytics, push notifications, and shared branding/config packages with the web/backend stacks to ensure cohesive cross-platform experiences.

6. **Cross-Platform Alignment and Governance**
   1. Establish a shared API contract (OpenAPI/Swagger) with generated clients for React and Flutter, plus versioned documentation to keep features synchronized.
   2. Create an enterprise rollout plan covering environment promotion, feature flags, and security reviews, aligning all stacks with compliance expectations.
   3. Implement coordinated release management—joint CI pipelines, automated end-to-end tests, and telemetry dashboards—to ensure features function across devices before Version 1.50 launch.
