# Fix Suggestions

## Backend Platform
1. **Deliver roadmap-critical APIs and feature flags**: Implement compliance workflow endpoints, dispute escalation services, and regional marketplace configuration routes. Introduce a centralised feature flag service (LaunchDarkly or internal) and wire guards across controllers and jobs for staged rollout control.
2. **Introduce API versioning and lifecycle controls**: Break out `src/routes/index.js` into versioned gateways (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`) with bounded contexts, enforce payload size limits and rate limiting in `src/app.js`, lock down CORS to trusted origins, add `/healthz`/`/readyz` endpoints, and update `src/server.js` to capture job handles, listen for `SIGTERM`, and drain background workers gracefully.
3. **Modernise background processing**: Refactor analytics ingestion and webhook handlers to publish to durable queues (BullMQ/SQS), add schema negotiation, and implement dead-letter routing. Document operational runbooks for queue monitoring and retries.
4. **Harden validation and observability**: Adopt schema validators (Joi/Zod) for all public controllers, convert logging to structured `pino` with correlation IDs, and add metrics exporters plus alerting thresholds for job failures and API SLAs. Ensure analytics ingestion bundles its own `fetch` polyfill for Node runtimes that disable the global API.
5. **Industrialise secrets and configuration management**: Integrate AWS Secrets Manager or Vault for runtime credential retrieval, generate `.env.example` files automatically, scrub default secrets from `src/config/index.js`, replace `backend-nodejs/sql/install.sql` with secure Postgres bootstrap tooling, and enforce periodic rotation policies in CI/CD pipelines.

## Dependency and Tooling
6. **Unify dependency strategy**: Standardise on npm workspaces with a single root lockfile, align Node runtime to v20, upgrade core libraries (`express`, `sequelize`, `jsonwebtoken`, React stack), and enable deterministic installs via `npm ci` with cache warmers in CI.
7. **Introduce supply chain safeguards**: Enable `npm audit signatures`, set up a private registry proxy (Artifactory/Nexus), generate SBOMs (CycloneDX for Node/Flutter), and integrate automated license scanning with policy gates.
8. **Stabilise Flutter toolchain**: Update CI images to Dart/Flutter 3.7+, automate `flutter pub upgrade` with lockfile verification, and document Apple Silicon and Windows build prerequisites alongside prebuilt native modules.

## Data Layer
9. **Extend schema for multi-region compliance**: Add `region_id` columns, partitioning/indexing strategies, audit/history tables, and GDPR-ready soft delete markers across transactional data. Update Sequelize models with explicit cascade policies and rehearse the migrations with anonymised datasets.
10. **Automate data governance**: Implement CDC pipelines for marketing/analytics warehouses, automate payment reconciliation with idempotent upserts, enable database auditing (pgaudit) and TLS, and schedule quarterly DR drills with documented RPO/RTO targets.

## Web Front-End
11. **Complete feature implementation and parity**: Build region-aware catalogue views, compliance dashboards, and admin workflows with fully wired API integrations and analytics instrumentation. Add Core Web Vitals and user timing reporting hooks.
12. **Stabilise routing and feature toggles**: Remove duplicate routes from `src/App.jsx`, introduce a catch-all fallback, wrap `<App />` in a shared error boundary/hydration guard, instrument route-level analytics, and update `src/providers/FeatureToggleProvider.jsx` to derive cohorts from stable IDs (user/session hashes) stored server-side instead of persisting raw payloads in sessionStorage.
13. **Remediate UX and accessibility debt**: Redesign navigation, responsive breakpoints, and form validation experiences; integrate automated axe and Lighthouse checks; and enforce WCAG 2.1 AA compliance via CI gating.
14. **Secure client runtime**: Migrate authentication storage to secure cookies, add CSP/header guidance, sanitise all user-generated content, and activate Sentry/DataDog for client-side error capture.

## Mobile User App
15. **Ship roadmap features with resilience**: Implement regional filters, compliance badges, dispute flows, and backend-integrated push notifications. Add offline caching policies for saved jobs/messages and integrate Crashlytics/Sentry for diagnostics.
16. **Upgrade platform integrations**: Patch Android 14 compatibility, migrate to Material 3 theming, upgrade payment SDKs with 3DS2, and add remote configuration (Firebase Remote Config) for staged rollouts. Standardise analytics events via shared schemas and ensure `_NavigationDestination.blog` is either implemented or removed.
17. **Improve mobile security posture**: Store credentials in `flutter_secure_storage`, implement root/jailbreak detection, enforce TLS pinning in production builds, scrub PII from release logging, and remove demo token fallbacks from production configs.

## Cross-Cutting Initiatives
18. **Codify infrastructure and operations**: Pin Terraform/Ansible provider versions, codify cron/queue infrastructure as IaC, and expand runbooks, SLAs, and incident response guides to cover multi-region operations.
19. **Align design, localisation, and analytics assets**: Publish shared design tokens and business logic packages, synchronise localisation files across platforms, and enforce analytics schema governance through contract tests and documentation.
20. **Establish observability and compliance baselines**: Deploy unified logging/metrics/tracing stacks, enable Core Web Vitals and Crashlytics monitoring, and formalise compliance checkpoints (GDPR, SOC 2, accessibility) with executive dashboards to track readiness.
