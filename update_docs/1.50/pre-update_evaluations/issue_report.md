# Issue Report – Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

## Backend Service Gaps
The backend remains functionally incomplete for the marketplace workflows promised in Version 1.50. Critical transactional routes (purchase lifecycle controls, dispute handling, inventory management) are missing, and existing flows such as `purchaseService` bypass business validations, risking inconsistent escrow state and mispriced orders. Operational resilience is weak because controllers ignore transactional integrity and provide inconsistent error contracts, leaving both clients and operators without reliable diagnostics. Security posture is additionally undermined by hard-coded secrets, permissive CORS, and the absence of rate limiting, while alignment with client experiences fails due to the lack of onboarding automation, multi-factor provisioning, and administrator role separation. These shortcomings block the backend from supporting enterprise-grade usage.

## Database Integrity Deficiencies
The relational schema mirrors current models but omits key domain concepts (notifications, analytics, scheduling) required by the product roadmap. Referential integrity is unenforced—foreign keys, uniqueness constraints, and lifecycle metadata are missing—allowing orphaned or duplicate records. Monetary fields lack precision definitions, complicating reconciliation across environments. Operational tooling is inadequate: there are no migrations, rollback plans, or seed data, leading to reproducibility gaps and making QA environments fragile. Default credentials, lack of encryption guidance, and absent audit trails expose sensitive data and contravene enterprise compliance expectations.

## Dependency and Tooling Misalignment
Across backend, frontend, and mobile stacks, dependency management is inconsistent and outdated. Node packages such as Express, Sequelize, and Tailwind are pinned to older minor versions without audit or upgrade plans, and there is no automated vulnerability scanning. Flutter dependencies are sparse and omit state management, secure storage, and analytics libraries expected for production readiness. Shared tooling is missing—no centralized environment configuration, no secret management strategy, and no observability or testing frameworks—creating integration drift and making coordinated releases risky. The lack of CI policies, lockfile enforcement, and runtime monitoring conflicts with the enterprise positioning of the release.

## Front-End Execution Risks
The React client is largely static: forms lack submission handlers, validation, and error feedback, so login, registration, and admin workflows cannot complete. Data-rich components rely on hard-coded mock content, meaning there is no live connection to backend services, authentication state, or analytics. Accessibility and responsiveness issues (missing ARIA labels, fixed-width grids) degrade usability across devices. Without global state management, error boundaries, or protected routing, the frontend cannot provide a resilient enterprise experience, and it misaligns with marketing promises such as real-time escrow dashboards and 2FA enforcement.

## Mobile (User App) Limitations
The Flutter app mirrors the web gaps: navigation and screens exist but are static brochures without API integrations, form validation, or feedback mechanisms. Input handling lacks controllers and accessibility considerations, while security-critical features (2FA toggles, credential handling, secure token storage) are non-functional. There is no offline strategy, retry logic, or error reporting, making the app unsuitable for release in environments where reliability is paramount. Cross-platform consistency suffers because branding, configuration, and data models are not shared with the web or backend layers.

## Cross-Cutting Alignment and Integration Failures
Taken together, the platform layers do not interoperate. There is no shared schema or DTO contract, no deployment-ready configuration, and no telemetry to synchronize behavior. Enterprise narratives—automated workflows, operational dashboards, and cross-device session continuity—lack any supporting implementation. Security, compliance, and operational tooling are inconsistent across stacks, preventing coordinated go-live. These issues must be addressed collectively to achieve the desired Version 1.50 capabilities.
