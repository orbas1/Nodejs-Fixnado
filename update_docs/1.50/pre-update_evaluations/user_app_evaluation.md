# User App (Flutter) Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- Navigation covers home, login, register, feed, profile, and search, but every screen is static. There are no API clients or bloc/providers to fetch data, so the app cannot authenticate, browse services, or manage escrow despite the UI claims.
- Live feed and marketplace lists are hard-coded arrays. There is no pagination, refresh, or filtering, making the experience purely demonstrative.
- Profile and search screens (once opened) only display placeholder cards; user-specific data (orders, 2FA status, saved services) is absent.

## Usability
- Screens share minimal design guidance. Forms use plain `TextField` widgets without controllers, validation messages, or keyboard management (e.g., closing keyboards on submit). This leads to a clunky onboarding experience.
- No localization or theming beyond a base color scheme. Strings are hard-coded in English and there is no dark-mode consideration.
- Accessibility is limited: semantics are not set on key widgets, and large tap targets are missing for drawer items. Scroll views lack `SafeArea` usage, causing potential overlap with notches/status bars.

## Errors
- Buttons trigger empty callbacks (e.g., `FilledButton(onPressed: () {})`), so users receive no feedback or error states. Network or validation failures cannot be surfaced because there is no infrastructure for them.
- There is no offline handling or retry logic; the app would silently fail if network calls were introduced later.
- Routes are defined statically without guards. Navigating to an undefined route throws an exception instead of presenting a graceful fallback screen.

## Integration
- Although the `http` package is declared, it is never used. There is no repository layer, no serialization of backend DTOs, and no secure storage for tokens.
- Push notifications, deep links, and analytics integrations are absent, which limits parity with the enterprise narrative of real-time operations.
- The Flutter app does not share assets or configuration with the web frontend. Even branding (logos) is not centralized, making cross-platform updates error-prone.

## Security
- Login screen toggles for email/Google 2FA do not connect to any logic, so enabling them has no effect. Sensitive credentials are typed into uncontrolled text fields without obscuring email addresses or providing password visibility toggles.
- There is no secure storage (`flutter_secure_storage`) or Keychain/Keystore usage for auth tokens, meaning any future implementation would need significant scaffolding to meet security requirements.
- Network stack lacks certificate pinning, TLS configuration, or error handling—critical for an app marketed as escrow-backed and enterprise-ready.

## Alignment
- Mobile copy mirrors web promises (live feed, escrow management), but without integrations the app functions as a static brochure. This misalignment risks user trust during beta testing.
- No shared design system with the React frontend; typography and components diverge, weakening brand cohesion.
- Cross-platform workflows (start on mobile, finish on web) are unsupported due to absent auth/session handling, undermining the broader Fixnado ecosystem goals for version 1.50.
