# Services Layer Changes â€“ Version 1.50

## 2025-03-12
- Rebuilt `backend-nodejs/src/services/panelService.js` to restore coherent provider dashboards: actor-aware company lookup, booking and rental analytics, trust/review scoring, and inventory insights now power the responses.
- Added business front aggregation that blends bookings, campaign telemetry, inventory, and marketplace moderation history to deliver consistent marketing snapshots with monetisation-aware savings messaging.
- Refreshed helper utilities (inventory summaries, review extracts, crew rosters) to eliminate undefined references and provide production-ready calculations for downstream controllers and tests.

## 2025-03-17
- Implemented `backend-nodejs/src/services/sessionService.js` to orchestrate refresh-token hashing, JWT access token issuance, cookie management, and session rotation/revocation workflows.
- Updated `backend-nodejs/src/controllers/authController.js` and `authRoutes.js` to rely on the new service for login, refresh, and logout flows, emitting secure cookies for browsers and bearer tokens for mobile clients.
- Added Vitest coverage (`tests/sessionService.test.js`) to validate issuance semantics, cookie hygiene, rotation persistence, and token extraction to guard against regressions.

## 2025-03-18
- Introduced `backend-nodejs/src/services/consentService.js` with subject resolution, ledger serialisation, WCAG-aware policy surfacing, and audit trail integration.
- Added `backend-nodejs/src/services/scamDetectionService.js` delivering heuristic scoring, optional AI enrichment, Opsgenie escalations, and deterministic fallbacks when third-party services time out.
- Updated `backend-nodejs/src/services/bookingService.js` to invoke scam detection during transactional booking creation, persisting risk insights without blocking core booking fulfilment.
- Published Vitest coverage (`tests/consentService.test.js`, `tests/scamDetectionService.test.js`) capturing ledger state transitions, required-policy enforcement, heuristic thresholds, and escalation logic to keep the services regression-safe.

## 2025-03-28
- Added `backend-nodejs/src/services/dataGovernanceService.js` encapsulating GDPR request submission, region resolution, export generation, rental/order/conversation snapshots, and sanitised audit logging.
- Implemented file-system export helpers that create region-specific directories, persist JSON payloads, and record metadata back onto the request for portal consumption.
- Wired the new service into controllers and jobs to ensure RBAC-protected data subject requests can be created, updated, exported, and purged according to the retention policy.

## 2025-03-30
- Introduced `backend-nodejs/src/services/dataWarehouseExportService.js` to batch-load orders, finance events, and communications history, serialise sanitised payloads to NDJSON.gz bundles, and persist export run metadata for audit replay.
- Added `backend-nodejs/src/services/databaseCredentialRotationService.js` leveraging AWS Secrets Manager to generate strong passwords, apply dialect-specific rotation SQL, terminate existing sessions, refresh secrets, and re-authenticate the Sequelize pool.

## 2025-04-08
- Expanded `backend-nodejs/src/services/dataGovernanceService.js` with SLA-aware due date assignment, backlog segmentation, percentile completion analytics, and region-aware metrics caching to power the new compliance dashboard KPIs.
- Introduced filter validation helpers supporting subject email normalisation, ISO range coercion, and region lookup reuse across listing and metrics pipelines, returning structured 400 errors for invalid inputs.
- Added Vitest coverage (`tests/dataGovernanceService.test.js`) exercising submission, filtering, metrics aggregation, and due-date calculations to keep SLA telemetry production-safe.
