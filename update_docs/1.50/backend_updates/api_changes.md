# API Changes

## Gateway Policies
- Health monitoring clients should switch from probing `/` to `/healthz` to receive structured diagnostics and HTTP 503 failover signals.
- Clients making cross-origin requests must ensure their origin appears in the central allowlist; partner onboarding runbooks have been updated to capture the new requirement.
- Excessive request bursts now receive HTTP 429 responses including a `retryAfterSeconds` hint, providing predictable behaviour for SDK backoff implementations.
