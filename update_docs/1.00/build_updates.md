# Build Updates — Version 1.00

## 2025-10-11 — Issue Intake Automation & Tracker Regeneration
- Added `scripts/issue-intake.mjs`, a Node-based CLI that validates structured payloads inside `update_docs/1.00/pre-update_evaluations/issue_report.md` and regenerates `issue_list.md` + `fix_suggestions.md` with computed SLA deadlines, ownership metadata, and design references.
- Documented run instructions (`node scripts/issue-intake.mjs`) and embedded automation hook into the QA test plan so CI can block inconsistent issue payloads before merge.
- Seeded issue artefacts with four high/critical findings from backend and frontend evaluations, ensuring the build pipeline exposes blockers to programme dashboards without manual transcription.

## 2025-10-13 — Infrastructure Bootstrap & Parity Automation
- Added `backend-nodejs/scripts/bootstrap-postgis.mjs` to create PostGIS, topology, and UUID extensions during deploys, preventing drift between Terraform provisioning and runtime requirements.
- Published `scripts/environment-parity.mjs` to compare staging/production tfvars plus feature toggle manifests; CI can run the script to halt promotions when configuration keys or rollout thresholds diverge.

## 2025-10-14 — CI/CD Hardening & Rollback Automation
- Introduced `Build, Test & Scan` GitHub Actions workflow enforcing backend, frontend, and Flutter lint/test gates plus secret scanning and dependency audits via `scripts/security-audit.mjs` and `gitleaks`.
- Added `Release Packaging` workflow that builds deployable artefacts (`backend-nodejs-release.tar.gz`, `frontend-reactjs-dist.tar.gz`, `flutter-app-debug.apk`) and publishes a checksum-driven manifest generated by `scripts/create-rollback-manifest.mjs`.
- Authored `docs/operations/rollback-playbook.md` detailing how to trigger the new workflow, validate artefacts, execute environment-safe rollbacks, and record incident evidence for audit readiness.
