# User App Evaluation – Version 1.00

## Functionality
- The Flutter app wires navigation across home, login, register, feed, profile, and search routes but every screen renders static copy with no API integration, so users cannot authenticate, browse real marketplace listings, or manage escrow (`lib/main.dart`, `lib/screens/*.dart`).
- Forms collect input but `onPressed` handlers are empty and no controllers/validation exist, meaning login and registration buttons do nothing (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`, `lib/screens/register_screen.dart`).
- Live feed widget displays a fixed list of three items, offering no pagination, refresh, or personalization capabilities expected from the product experience (`lib/widgets/live_feed_list.dart`).

## Usability
- Layouts rely heavily on `Column` without responsiveness; long forms easily overflow on smaller devices because there is no keyboard-aware scrolling or input grouping (`lib/screens/register_screen.dart`).
- Accessibility considerations (semantics, larger tap targets, focus order) are missing; switches for 2FA and buttons share default labels that screen readers may not differentiate.
- Theme customization is minimal and there is no dark mode or adaptive styling, reducing usability for field technicians operating in different lighting conditions.

## Errors
- No error handling is implemented for network failures, validation, or authentication—once API calls are added the UI will not surface meaningful feedback to users.
- Input fields lack controllers, so state cannot be reset after submission or when navigating away, leading to stale data issues.
- There is no logging or analytics instrumentation to capture client-side exceptions, hindering QA and support efforts.

## Integration
- App imports `http` but never configures a client, base URL, or dependency injection, signaling that service integration has not been started (`pubspec.yaml`).
- There is no secure storage for JWT/session tokens, no push notification setup, and no deep link handling, blocking alignment with backend authentication and notification flows.
- Navigation stack does not enforce auth guards; protected areas like profile are reachable without login, so integration with backend auth will require significant refactoring.

## Security
- Login and register screens lack secure text input handling (no obscuring toggles, no password confirmation) and will transmit credentials in plaintext once wired to the backend.
- The app stores no device or session metadata, preventing the enforcement of multi-factor authentication or device revocation.
- Without TLS pinning, certificate validation customization, or dependency on secure storage plugins, the mobile client cannot meet enterprise security expectations.

## Alignment
- Mobile experience does not reflect the complex workflows shown on web (no service purchasing, no escrow updates), so stakeholders cannot validate cross-platform parity.
- Absence of localization, offline support, and role-based UI contradicts positioning as a field-ready operations tool.
- Design language diverges from the React front-end, threatening brand consistency and user familiarity across platforms.
