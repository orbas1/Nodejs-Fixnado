# Backend Evaluation â€“ Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Coverage of core marketplace flows is partial; there are endpoints for authentication, feeds, services, search, and admin metrics, but nothing exposes post creation, dispute lifecycle, escrow release, or notifications, leaving large sections of the documented product story unimplemented (`src/controllers/*.js`).
- Business rules are thin: `createService` blindly trusts the authenticated user without checking role-based permissions or enforcing company onboarding, and `purchaseService` auto-funds orders with no escrow funding confirmation or pricing validation (`src/controllers/serviceController.js`).
- Search endpoints do not paginate or allow filtering by location/status, so any realistic data volume will either truncate results at 20 items or overwhelm clients (`src/services/searchService.js`).

## Usability
- Error messaging is inconsistent; the global handler always returns `{"message":"Internal server error"}` for uncaught issues, giving clients no actionable insight and complicating support triage (`src/middleware/errorHandler.js`).
- Validation feedback from `express-validator` surfaces raw field rules but omits contextual hints (e.g., password complexity guidance), and there is no localization framework for user-facing copy (`src/routes/authRoutes.js`).
- Authentication responses mix snake_case and camelCase properties, and profile responses expose entire Sequelize models, creating noisy payloads that front-end consumers must reshape (`src/controllers/authController.js`).

## Errors
- The registration path creates a `User` record and then conditionally a `Company` without wrapping the sequence in a transaction; any failure after the user insert leaves orphan users or companies and requires manual cleanup (`src/controllers/authController.js`).
- Critical operations lack try/catch fallbacks beyond the global handler, so operational errors (database timeouts, queue failures) surface only as 500s with console logs, providing no telemetry or structured logging for observability (`src/middleware/errorHandler.js`).
- Sequelize associations are defined but no defensive checks ensure eager-loaded relationships exist before dereferencing them, exposing the API to runtime `null` reference crashes when optional relations are missing (`src/models/index.js`).

## Integration
- Escrow handling is modeled but not integrated with any payment gateway or webhook verification; the API marks orders as `funded` and creates escrows without coordinating with third-party processors, undermining real-world viability (`src/controllers/serviceController.js`).
- There is no outbound communication (email/SMS) pipeline for confirmations or two-factor flows even though the apps surface 2FA toggles, signaling a disconnect between UI and backend capabilities.
- Admin metrics aggregate only internal counts and do not join with analytics, auditing, or CRM systems, limiting enterprise reporting expectations (`src/controllers/adminController.js`).

## Security
- Default configuration ships with placeholder secrets (`config/index.js`), no environment validation, and no rotation strategy; if `.env` is misconfigured the API still boots with insecure defaults.
- Authentication lacks rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or lockout policies, making brute-force attacks trivial; JWT validation also accepts any token signed with the static secret and does not enforce token revocation (`src/middleware/auth.js`).
- Authorization is coarse: any authenticated user can create services or purchase orders regardless of role, and admin access is gated only by a simple `type === 'company'` check, which does not differentiate between regular company accounts and actual administrators (`src/routes/serviceRoutes.js`, `src/routes/adminRoutes.js`).

## Alignment
- Front-end and mobile flows advertise two-factor authentication, escrow release workflows, and rich live feeds, yet corresponding backend endpoints are missing, indicating product alignment gaps that will block end-to-end demos.
- Data contracts are inconsistent with documented database schema (e.g., API exposes camelCase fields while migrations create snake_case columns), increasing friction for analytics and ETL pipelines.
- There is no documented health check, OpenAPI specification, or deployment guidance, so DevOps teams lack the artefacts required for staging/production rollout, conflicting with enterprise-readiness goals.
