# Front-end Evaluation – Version 1.00

## Functionality
- Routing covers many flows (home, login, register, feed, admin dashboard) but most pages are static marketing content with no data fetching or mutation logic, so critical interactions like authentication, marketplace browsing, and escrow management cannot actually run (`src/App.jsx`, `src/pages/*.jsx`).
- Forms (login, registration, company onboarding) submit nowhere—`<form>` tags lack `onSubmit` handlers and never call the backend, so users cannot complete account creation or sign-in (`src/pages/Login.jsx`, `src/pages/Register.jsx`).
- Admin dashboard, feed, and search pages rely on hard-coded placeholder arrays, preventing pagination, filtering, or personalization promised in the product narrative (`src/components/LiveFeed.jsx`, `src/pages/Feed.jsx`).

## Usability
- Accessibility is inconsistent: interactive elements such as custom checkboxes and icon buttons lack ARIA attributes or keyboard focus management, impacting WCAG compliance (`src/pages/Login.jsx`, `src/components/Header.jsx`).
- Responsive behavior is partially addressed with Tailwind utilities but some layouts (e.g., multi-column hero sections) break on small screens due to fixed widths and min-heights (`src/components/Hero.jsx`).
- There are no loading or empty states; if data fetching is later wired in, users will see blank sections with no feedback while requests resolve.

## Errors
- Without form submission handlers there is no client-side validation or error messaging, so any API validation error would go unrendered and block user progress.
- Axios is declared as a dependency but never configured with interceptors or error boundaries, so network failures will bubble up as unhandled promise rejections once integration begins (`package.json`).
- React Router routes do not guard against unauthorized access; hitting `/admin/dashboard` renders the page even for anonymous visitors, which will cause confusing redirects once authentication is added.

## Integration
- No `.env` consumption or configuration abstraction exists; all endpoints would need to be hard-coded or manually injected, complicating deployments across environments.
- Component structure does not align with backend payloads—services expect `name`, `category`, `price` fields that differ from backend `title` and `price` conventions, signaling future integration mismatches (`src/components/ServiceCard.jsx` vs. backend service model).
- Shared UI states (e.g., authentication session) are missing; there is no context provider or state management plan to coordinate user data across routes.

## Security
- Forms submit plaintext credentials without HTTPS enforcement or input sanitization, and there is no plan for CSRF protection or token storage strategy.
- Admin routes are publicly accessible in the router configuration, so without additional guards sensitive screens may expose internal data during a build preview (`src/App.jsx`).
- External image assets load from remote URLs with no CSP guidance, potentially introducing mixed content or tracking pixels (`src/constants/branding.js`).

## Alignment
- Marketing copy highlights two-factor authentication, live operations monitoring, and escrow controls, but the UI only presents cosmetic toggles with no functionality, undermining stakeholder trust.
- Component styling and layout do not match the Flutter mobile experience, weakening cross-platform brand coherence promised in the update brief.
- Lack of analytics hooks or instrumentation contradicts enterprise expectations around telemetry and customer journey tracking.
