- Forms highlight required vs optional fields using iconography and tooltips to minimise completion errors.
- Navigation breadcrumbs added for deep admin flows to improve orientation.

### Handoff Requirements
1. Provide responsive measurements for breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) including collapsed navigation states.
2. Document skeleton states for tables, cards, and charts to ensure consistent loading experiences.
3. Supply component naming aligned with React component library (`<ZoneAnalyticsMap>`, `<BookingStepper>`).
4. Include accessibility annotations (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation) within wireframe notes for developer reference.
