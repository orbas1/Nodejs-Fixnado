# Web Application Design Update Overview â€” Version 1.00

## Summary
The Version 1.00 web redesign establishes a unified enterprise-grade experience for consumers, providers, and administrators. It harmonises navigation, responsive behaviour, and design tokens across modules (Explorer, Booking, Marketplace, Compliance, Analytics) while delivering detailed guidance for component styling, asset management, and logic flows.

## Goals
1. Deliver actionable dashboards with real-time metrics and task queues.
2. Streamline zone discovery and booking flows with map-driven interactions.
3. Enable monetisation through package configurators and campaign management.
4. Improve compliance workflows with document tracking and automated reminders.
5. Ensure accessibility, performance, and localisation readiness.

## Key Deliverables
- Comprehensive component specifications (`component_types.md`, `buttons.md`, `Forms.md`, `Cards.md`).
- Detailed page plans for home, dashboards, profiles, settings, and admin routes.
- Responsive behaviour documentation (`Screen Size Changes.md`, `Placement.md`).
- Asset and resource inventories for imagery, vectors, packages, and settings.
- Logic and functional updates aligning UI flows with backend APIs.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation**: Integrate design tokens, global styles, base layouts.
2. **Core Experiences**: Build Explorer, Dashboard, Booking, Marketplace flows.
3. **Supporting Modules**: Settings, Messaging, Compliance enhancements.
4. **Polish**: Accessibility audits, performance tuning, localisation.

## Stakeholder Alignment
- Weekly design-engineering sync on Wednesdays 16:00 UTC.
- Product review milestone every sprint (bi-weekly) with executive summary referencing `design_change_log.md`.
- QA sign-off requires completion of logic flow tests and UI regression suite.

## Next Actions
- Publish Storybook updates with new components and tokens.
- Coordinate with backend to validate data contracts for analytics and packages.
- Conduct usability testing sessions focusing on booking wizard and package configurator.
