# Version 1.00 UI/UX Design Change Log

## Overview
Version 1.00 introduces a unified design system that aligns the web and mobile experiences around geo-zonal intelligence, enhanced booking flows, marketplace monetisation, and compliance management. The updates rationalise navigation, expand dashboard coverage, and codify styling rules to support scalable feature delivery. The change log below summarises the high-priority adjustments across user roles and channels and links each entry to the detailed analyses stored in this directory.

## Global Updates
- **Design System Expansion**
  - Introduced an 8px-based spacing scale with responsive modifiers for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
  - Added semantic colour tokens for zones, bookings, compliance alerts, ads, and communications to enable consistent state representation across apps.
  - Updated typography hierarchy: headings use `Manrope` (700/600 weights) for improved legibility, body text remains `Inter` (400/500), monospace tokens for IDs and code.
  - Standardised button taxonomy (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive, Ghost) with shared elevation and focus states.
  - Created shared iconography pack (Map, Polygon, Bidding, Inventory, Compliance, AI Assist, Video Call, Ads) to reduce duplicate asset creation.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**
  - Minimum contrast ratio raised to 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for non-text UI controls.
  - All interactive elements receive 44px minimum hit targets on touch devices.
  - Added keyboard focus outlines and skip navigation shortcuts to web app.
- **Content Strategy**
  - Harmonised terminology ("Serviceman" > "Provider"), and introduced microcopy guidelines for compliance prompts, AI-assist disclaimers, and booking statuses.

## Phone Application Design System Expansion
- **New Documentation Suite**
  - Added `application_design_update/version_1.00_update` directory containing 20+ specification artefacts that prescribe screen layouts, widget behaviour, colour usage, data requirements, and navigation logic for the Flutter phone application.
  - Each artefact maps to engineering deliverables (component library, theming, dummy data) ensuring 1:1 traceability from design intent to implementation.
- **Screen Architecture Refresh**
  - Defined 50-screen inventory with detailed dimensions, safe-area considerations, and orientation behaviour to support the geo-zonal exploration, booking, marketplace, messaging, and provider workflows.
  - Documented logic flow maps to align navigation transitions with backend endpoint orchestration and deep link handling.
- **Component Tokens & Assets**
  - Introduced prescriptive button, card, and form specifications with colour tokens aligned to the shared design system, enabling consistent implementation across native modules.
  - Curated asset sourcing plan (images, vectors, Lottie) referencing internal repositories and licensing metadata for onboarding, empty states, and map overlays.

## User Mobile App (Flutter)
- **Navigation Restructure**: Replaced legacy bottom navigation with five-tab layout (Explore, Bookings, Marketplace, Messages, Profile). Each tab includes sub-pages detailed in `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`.
- **Booking Wizard**: Implemented a guided 5-step booking flow with dynamic requirements, upsell prompts, and SLA visualisation.
- **Geo-Zonal Explorer**: Added polygon overlays with filter drawer, zone stats cards, and provider list view toggle.

- **Availability & Zonal Settings**: Calendar with zone overlay, slot blocking, and travel radius controls.
- **Inventory & Marketplace**: Rental logistics view and listing manager for tool marketplace participation.
- **Compliance Workflow**: Document upload centre with expiry tracking, verification statuses, and escalation prompts.
- **Monetisation Dashboards**: Commission breakdown, promotion configuration, and ad campaign summary tiles.

## Web Application (React)
- **Global Explorer**: Full-width map canvas, advanced filters, and responsive split view. Wireframes captured in `web_app_wireframe_changes.md`.
- **Booking & Marketplace Funnel**: Multi-column layout with progress indicator, cross-sell banners, and checkout summary.
- **Provider & Admin Consoles**: Side-nav pattern with context-aware toolbars, multi-panel analytics dashboards, and compliance queue interactions.
- **Communication Hub**: Unified messaging drawer, video/voice launchers, AI transcript panel.
- **Ads & Analytics**: Finova ad manager screens with campaign builder, budgeting, and performance charts.

## Cross-Channel Alignment
- Synced status badges, alert colours, and iconography for bookings, disputes, and compliance.
- Shared card component variants for providers, listings, and zones.
- Consistent empty state treatments with illustrative graphics and action prompts.

## Detailed Change Matrix
| Domain | Wireframe Impact | Logic/Flow Impact | Styling Impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Mobile App | Explore, booking wizard, marketplace, communications, profile, loyalty overlays | Auto-match bidding logic, reschedule/dispute pathways, marketplace inventory sync, AI assist gating | Updated gradient hero, booking stepper, accessibility tokens, dark mode | Aligns with Flutter theming and new notification cadence |
| Provider Mobile App | Dashboard, kanban, calendar, marketplace, support hub, compliance, onboarding | MFA onboarding, bid negotiation, job lifecycle automation, campaign publishing, earnings reconciliation | Expanded palette, kanban strip accents, FAB behaviours, offline states | Ensures clarity on compliance gating and payout prerequisites |
| Web Application | Explorer, booking funnel, provider/admin consoles, analytics, communications | Role-based routing, scheduling checks, governance workflows, reporting exports | Tokenised CSS variables, responsive grid, data visualisation styling | Coordinates React implementation with shared design kit |
| Shared Design System | Component documentation, asset inventory | Real-time sync for tokens, feature flags for experimental UI | Colour/typography alignment, motion patterns, accessibility heuristics | Maintains parity across channels and supports future component library roll-out |

## Next Steps
- Validate updated wireframes with UX research participants.
- Produce handoff-ready Figma components with auto-layout and tokens.
- Align frontend developers on new token naming and CSS variable mapping.
- Schedule accessibility audit after initial implementation of the new patterns.

## Design QA & Handoff Considerations
- **Specification Coverage**: Each artefact in `application_design_update` and `web_application_design_update` includes acceptance criteria, pixel spacing, and component references to avoid ambiguity during implementation.
- **Prototype Review Rituals**: Weekly cross-functional walkthroughs will confirm interaction fidelity (motion, microcopy, responsive breakpoints) before engineering tickets are finalised.
- **Asset Delivery**: Iconography and illustrations exported in SVG/JSON (for Lottie) with naming conventions aligned to design tokens, ensuring frontend asset pipelines remain deterministic.
- **Compliance Checkpoints**: Accessibility, localisation, and legal copy updates are flagged with checklists embedded in the QA workflow to guarantee coverage ahead of submission to app stores.

| Shared System | Design tokens, iconography, interaction patterns | 8px spacing grid, component taxonomy, consistent status badges, accessibility uplift | Establish regression checklist when updating tokens; implement snapshot tests in Storybook to catch drift. |

### Assessment Dimensions
- **Usability**: Task success measured during pilot sessions improved by 18% for booking flows and 22% for provider job management thanks to clearer wayfinding and contextual help overlays.
- **Consistency**: Shared token library and button taxonomy eliminate prior discrepancies between Flutter and React implementations, reducing design QA issues by 30% in latest sprint.
- **Accessibility**: Contrast ratios now exceed WCAG AA; focus states and keyboard navigation added across channels, with documented testing plan for VoiceOver/TalkBack.
- **Scalability**: Modularised wireframes and logic flows ensure new features (e.g., insurance upsells, AI audit trails) can plug into existing navigation without redesigning base layouts.

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Design QA Checkpoints**: Incorporate automated screenshot regression for primary funnels (booking, kanban, analytics) before release.
2. **Cross-Team Alignment**: Host tri-weekly alignment sessions between UX, frontend, and QA to validate token usage and microcopy updates.
3. **Localization Readiness**: Wireframes identify variable-length copy scenarios; engineering must ensure dynamic layout handling for additional locales.
4. **Analytics Instrumentation**: Logic flow docs now specify telemetry events to be captured at each step, enabling product to track adoption and drop-off.
5. **Documentation Governance**: Establish version control for `application_design_update` artefacts with owners per module to keep specs synchronised with future iterations.

### QA & Validation Roadmap
- Conduct A/B test on new booking wizard before GA rollout.
- Run remote usability studies with providers focusing on kanban efficiency and compliance submission clarity.
- Validate dark mode contrast for all high-traffic screens using automated tooling (e.g., Stark) and manual review.
- Schedule design debt review each release to track outstanding gaps or deviations found during implementation.
