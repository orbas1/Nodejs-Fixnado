# Version 1.00 UI/UX Design Change Log

## Overview
Version 1.00 introduces a unified design system that aligns the web and mobile experiences around geo-zonal intelligence, enhanced booking flows, marketplace monetisation, and compliance management. The updates rationalise navigation, expand dashboard coverage, and codify styling rules to support scalable feature delivery. The change log below summarises the high-priority adjustments across user roles and channels and links each entry to the detailed analyses stored in this directory.

## Global Updates
- **Design System Expansion**
  - Introduced an 8px-based spacing scale with responsive modifiers for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
  - Added semantic colour tokens for zones, bookings, compliance alerts, ads, and communications to enable consistent state representation across apps.
  - Updated typography hierarchy: headings use `Manrope` (700/600 weights) for improved legibility, body text remains `Inter` (400/500), monospace tokens for IDs and code.
  - Standardised button taxonomy (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive, Ghost) with shared elevation and focus states.
  - Created shared iconography pack (Map, Polygon, Bidding, Inventory, Compliance, AI Assist, Video Call, Ads) to reduce duplicate asset creation.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**
  - Minimum contrast ratio raised to 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for non-text UI controls.
  - All interactive elements receive 44px minimum hit targets on touch devices.
  - Added keyboard focus outlines and skip navigation shortcuts to web app.
- **Content Strategy**
  - Harmonised terminology ("Serviceman" > "Provider"), and introduced microcopy guidelines for compliance prompts, AI-assist disclaimers, and booking statuses.

## Phone Application Design System Expansion
- **New Documentation Suite**
  - Added `application_design_update/version_1.00_update` directory containing 20+ specification artefacts that prescribe screen layouts, widget behaviour, colour usage, data requirements, and navigation logic for the Flutter phone application.
  - Each artefact maps to engineering deliverables (component library, theming, dummy data) ensuring 1:1 traceability from design intent to implementation.
- **Screen Architecture Refresh**
  - Defined 50-screen inventory with detailed dimensions, safe-area considerations, and orientation behaviour to support the geo-zonal exploration, booking, marketplace, messaging, and provider workflows.
  - Documented logic flow maps to align navigation transitions with backend endpoint orchestration and deep link handling.
- **Component Tokens & Assets**
  - Introduced prescriptive button, card, and form specifications with colour tokens aligned to the shared design system, enabling consistent implementation across native modules.
  - Curated asset sourcing plan (images, vectors, Lottie) referencing internal repositories and licensing metadata for onboarding, empty states, and map overlays.

## User Mobile App (Flutter)
- **Navigation Restructure**: Replaced legacy bottom navigation with five-tab layout (Explore, Bookings, Marketplace, Messages, Profile). Each tab includes sub-pages detailed in `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`.
- **Booking Wizard**: Implemented a guided 5-step booking flow with dynamic requirements, upsell prompts, and SLA visualisation.
- **Geo-Zonal Explorer**: Added polygon overlays with filter drawer, zone stats cards, and provider list view toggle.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Combined rentals and purchases, surfacing insured seller badges and add-on recommendations.
- **Communication Layer**: Introduced persistent chat composer with AI assist toggle and Agora call controls.
- **Compliance & Consent**: Added GDPR consent modal, location permission gating, and payment authorisation steps.

## Provider Mobile App (Flutter)
- **Home Dashboard Refresh**: New hero summarising active jobs, earnings, compliance alerts, and zone coverage.
- **Job Lifecycle Tools**: Dedicated kanban for job statuses (New, Bidding, Scheduled, On Site, Completed, Disputed). Detailed in `provider_application_logic_flow_changes.md`.
- **Availability & Zonal Settings**: Calendar with zone overlay, slot blocking, and travel radius controls.
- **Inventory & Marketplace**: Rental logistics view and listing manager for tool marketplace participation.
- **Compliance Workflow**: Document upload centre with expiry tracking, verification statuses, and escalation prompts.
- **Monetisation Dashboards**: Commission breakdown, promotion configuration, and ad campaign summary tiles.

## Web Application (React)
- **Global Explorer**: Full-width map canvas, advanced filters, and responsive split view. Wireframes captured in `web_app_wireframe_changes.md`.
- **Booking & Marketplace Funnel**: Multi-column layout with progress indicator, cross-sell banners, and checkout summary.
- **Provider & Admin Consoles**: Side-nav pattern with context-aware toolbars, multi-panel analytics dashboards, and compliance queue interactions.
- **Communication Hub**: Unified messaging drawer, video/voice launchers, AI transcript panel.
- **Ads & Analytics**: Finova ad manager screens with campaign builder, budgeting, and performance charts.

## Cross-Channel Alignment
- Synced status badges, alert colours, and iconography for bookings, disputes, and compliance.
- Shared card component variants for providers, listings, and zones.
- Consistent empty state treatments with illustrative graphics and action prompts.

## Next Steps
- Validate updated wireframes with UX research participants.
- Produce handoff-ready Figma components with auto-layout and tokens.
- Align frontend developers on new token naming and CSS variable mapping.
- Schedule accessibility audit after initial implementation of the new patterns.
