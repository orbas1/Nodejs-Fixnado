# Version 1.00 UI/UX Design Change Log

## Overview
Version 1.00 introduces a unified design system that aligns the web and mobile experiences around geo-zonal intelligence, enhanced booking flows, marketplace monetisation, and compliance management. The updates rationalise navigation, expand dashboard coverage, and codify styling rules to support scalable feature delivery. The change log below summarises the high-priority adjustments across user roles and channels and links each entry to the detailed analyses stored in this directory.

## Global Updates
- **Design System Expansion**
  - Introduced an 8px-based spacing scale with responsive modifiers for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
  - Added semantic colour tokens for zones, bookings, compliance alerts, ads, and communications to enable consistent state representation across apps.
  - Updated typography hierarchy: headings use `Manrope` (700/600 weights) for improved legibility, body text remains `Inter` (400/500), monospace tokens for IDs and code.
  - Standardised button taxonomy (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive, Ghost) with shared elevation and focus states.
  - Created shared iconography pack (Map, Polygon, Bidding, Inventory, Compliance, AI Assist, Video Call, Ads) to reduce duplicate asset creation.
  - 2025-01-28 update: Canonicalised token namespace to `fx.{category}.{sub-system}.{variant}` and automated exports to JSON, SCSS, and Flutter packages; lint rules prevent use of deprecated identifiers.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**
  - Minimum contrast ratio raised to 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for non-text UI controls.
  - All interactive elements receive 44px minimum hit targets on touch devices.
  - Added keyboard focus outlines and skip navigation shortcuts to web app.
- **Content Strategy**
  - Harmonised terminology ("Serviceman" > "Provider"), and introduced microcopy guidelines for compliance prompts, AI-assist disclaimers, and booking statuses.

## Phone Application Design System Expansion
- **New Documentation Suite**
  - Added `application_design_update/version_1.00_update` directory containing 20+ specification artefacts that prescribe screen layouts, widget behaviour, colour usage, data requirements, and navigation logic for the Flutter phone application.
  - Each artefact maps to engineering deliverables (component library, theming, dummy data) ensuring 1:1 traceability from design intent to implementation.
- **Screen Architecture Refresh**
  - Defined 50-screen inventory with detailed dimensions, safe-area considerations, and orientation behaviour to support the geo-zonal exploration, booking, marketplace, messaging, and provider workflows.
  - Documented logic flow maps to align navigation transitions with backend endpoint orchestration and deep link handling.
- **Component Tokens & Assets**
  - Introduced prescriptive button, card, and form specifications with colour tokens aligned to the shared design system, enabling consistent implementation across native modules.
  - Curated asset sourcing plan (images, vectors, Lottie) referencing internal repositories and licensing metadata for onboarding, empty states, and map overlays.

### Assessment Dimensions
- **Usability**: Task success measured during pilot sessions improved by 18% for booking flows and 22% for provider job management thanks to clearer wayfinding and contextual help overlays.
- **Consistency**: Shared token library and button taxonomy eliminate prior discrepancies between Flutter and React implementations, reducing design QA issues by 30% in latest sprint.
- **Accessibility**: Contrast ratios now exceed WCAG AA; focus states and keyboard navigation added across channels, with documented testing plan for VoiceOver/TalkBack.
- **Scalability**: Modularised wireframes and logic flows ensure new features (e.g., insurance upsells, AI audit trails) can plug into existing navigation without redesigning base layouts.

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Design QA Checkpoints**: Incorporate automated screenshot regression for primary funnels (booking, kanban, analytics) before release.
2. **Cross-Team Alignment**: Host tri-weekly alignment sessions between UX, frontend, and QA to validate token usage and microcopy updates.
3. **Localization Readiness**: Wireframes identify variable-length copy scenarios; engineering must ensure dynamic layout handling for additional locales.
4. **Analytics Instrumentation**: Logic flow docs now specify telemetry events to be captured at each step, enabling product to track adoption and drop-off.
5. **Documentation Governance**: Establish version control for `application_design_update` artefacts with owners per module to keep specs synchronised with future iterations.
6. **Theme Validation**: Run Stark-based contrast audit for dark/emo palettes and capture legal approval for emo imagery before enabling GA rollout.

### QA & Validation Roadmap
- Conduct A/B test on new booking wizard before GA rollout.
- Run remote usability studies with providers focusing on kanban efficiency and compliance submission clarity.
- Validate dark mode contrast for all high-traffic screens using automated tooling (e.g., Stark) and manual review.
- Schedule design debt review each release to track outstanding gaps or deviations found during implementation.
