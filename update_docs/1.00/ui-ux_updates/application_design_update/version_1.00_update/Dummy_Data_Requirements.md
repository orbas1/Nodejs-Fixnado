## File Locations
- JSON fixtures stored in `/assets/mock_data/v1.00/` with naming `providers.json`, `zones.json`, etc.
- Provide CSV exports for analytics validation.

## Behavioural Requirements
- Each dataset includes localization fields (`title_en`, `title_es`).
- Provide placeholder image URLs referencing CDN or local assets (IDs matching `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`).
- For Map polygons, supply GeoJSON with coordinates for offline map.

## Refresh Cadence
- Update dummy data monthly or when backend schema changes.
- Maintain script `scripts/mock-data/generate_phone_v1.py` to rehydrate.
