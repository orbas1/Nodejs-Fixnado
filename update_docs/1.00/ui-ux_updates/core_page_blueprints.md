# Core Page Blueprint Recomposition — Version 1.00

## Overview
The second design milestone recomposes the primary web blueprints so navigation, compliance, and marketing flows align with the updated design system. The recomposed layouts are implemented in the React application and mirror the artefacts shared in `Web_Application_Design_Update`. Each blueprint enforces a 12-column grid, persona-aware navigation, and explicit instrumentation hooks to support analytics and compliance teams.

## Implemented Blueprints
### 1. Home & Discovery (Consumer Web)
- **Navigation Architecture:** Introduced persona-led navigation clusters (`Solutions`, `Industries`, `Platform`, `Resources`) with anchor links to recomposed sections (`/#home-*`). Hero messaging now references escrow guardrails, persona toggles, and liquidity proof. Implemented in `src/pages/Home.jsx` with reusable `BlueprintSection` primitives.
- **Conversion Surfaces:** Service packages render as canonical cards exposing pricing guidance, SLA guarantees, and knowledge-base IDs. Adoption signals (CTA uplift, bounce reduction, booking starts) surface from analytics instrumentation to reinforce decisions.
- **Marketing & Trust:** Campaign rails consolidate partner assurances, executive storytelling, and case-study metadata. Assets reference Contentful entries and legal renewal dates to streamline marketing governance.
- **Operational Overlays:** Embedded zone coverage map, compliance summaries, and instrumentation events to preview operational readiness before onboarding.

### 2. Admin Governance Dashboard
- **Page Header:** Added breadcrumb strategy (`Operations > Admin dashboard`), audit pack CTA, and meta snapshot (escrow, SLA, disputes). Implemented in `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` using the `PageHeader` component.
- **Command Metrics:** Expanded metrics to include escrow volume, disputes, live jobs, SLA compliance, plus security and automation sidebars.
- **Compliance & Security:** Dedicated control queue with audit timeline and escalation playbooks ensures compliance teams track expiring credentials and privacy requests.
- **Operational Queues:** Summaries for provider verification and dispute resolution align with automated reminders and AI summarisation pilots.

### 3. Provider Profile Blueprint
- **Structured Header:** Provider profile now uses `PageHeader` for breadcrumbs, share/request CTAs, and performance meta (rating, response time, escrow releases).
- **Service Catalogue:** Packages detail SLA, pricing, and job counts. Sidebar surfaces localisation coverage and compliance documents with expiry metadata.
- **Operations & Tooling:** Availability windows, marketplace inventory, and knowledge base references help enterprise buyers validate readiness.
- **Engagement Workflow:** Discovery → Execution → Post-job flow emphasises escrow alignment, audit artefacts, and follow-up scheduling.

### 4. Services & Marketing Hub
- **Solution Streams:** Enterprise, SMB, and marketplace bundles documented with compliance guardrails and localisation timeline.
- **Marketing Modules:** Conversion experiences defined through reusable marketing enhancements with performance metrics surfaced alongside.
- **Activation Blueprint:** Clear three-step journey from scoping to optimisation; each stage highlights escrow and compliance integration.

## Shared Component Upgrades
- **`PageHeader` Component:** New blueprint header supporting breadcrumbs, CTAs, and meta panels to align with navigation and compliance requirements.
- **`BlueprintSection` Component:** Reusable grid wrapper with optional aside, anchor IDs, and consistent styling for blueprint documentation across pages.
- **Header Navigation:** Updated top-level navigation to match persona-led clusters and anchor into recomposed sections.

## Instrumentation & Compliance Notes
- `Home.jsx` defines analytics events (`gtm.home.*`) to track nav interactions, CTA clicks, and service card engagement.
- Admin dashboard surfaces automation backlog and security signals, aligning with SOC monitoring requirements.
- Provider profile emphasises compliance documents (DBS, NIC EIC, insurance) with expiry dates to aid legal audits.
- Services hub references localisation rollout statuses, ensuring marketing copy remains audit-ready across locales.

## Next Actions
1. Wire navigation anchors into marketing automation journeys for attribution consistency.
2. Extend `BlueprintSection` primitives into Storybook for engineering QA and automated snapshot testing.
3. Coordinate with localisation to finalise Spanish (MX) copy blocks ahead of Sprint 4.
4. Validate instrumentation events in Looker dashboards to confirm metric baselines.
