# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Compliance evidence pack finalised: refreshed DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline document hashed-IP governance, Secrets Manager TTL enforcement, and JIT workflows mapped to design drawings. Task 1 exits Milestone M1 with regulator-ready artefacts and action tracker feeding future audits. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 32 | 22 | 18 | 20 | 24 | 15 | 22 | Zone service scaffolding and booking workflow specs drafted; implementation waits on security review of geo utilities. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 96 | 100 | 98 | 99 | 95 | 98 | 98 | Monetisation telemetry now streams into the analytics warehouse via `CampaignAnalyticsExport` outbox + exporter job, while `CampaignFraudSignal` catalogues overspend/underspend/CTR/CVR/delivery gap/no-spend anomalies. `/api/campaigns` exposes targeting replacement, metrics ingestion, fraud listing/resolution, and KPI summary endpoints; `campaignService.js` computes CTR/CVR/anomaly scores and manages export retries. Vitest suites (`tests/campaignRoutes.test.js`, `tests/campaignAnalyticsJob.test.js`) assert outbox creation, anomaly detection/resolution, exporter retry/backoff, and API key header wiring. Documentation (backend/database/design change logs, trackers, drawings) now details analytics export tiles, fraud anomaly rails, notification flows, and mobile parity so finance/fraud ops have governed UX + runbooks, marking Task 3 production-complete. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 86 | 84 | 82 | 83 | 74 | 78 | 82 | Provider and enterprise dashboards now surface live metrics via `/provider/dashboard`, `/enterprise/panel`, and `/api/business-fronts/:slug` with RBAC-aware navigation. React routes, mega-menu, and panel pages hydrate bookings, inventory, fraud, and compliance telemetry with skeleton, error, and token handling aligned to backend tests. Business fronts expose operational showcases and support channels, unblocking Flutter parity workstreams. Remaining scope concentrates on accessibility/localisation sweeps (Subtask 4.5) and mobile parity instrumentation. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 78 | 46 | 44 | 45 | 52 | 40 | 46 | Unified analytics event catalogue now persists governed payloads with tenant inference, actor context, and metadata validation via `analyticsEventService`. Zone, booking, rental, campaign, and communications services emit catalogued events for lifecycle transitions, with Vitest assertions covering persisted envelopes and regression payload checks. Documentation, database change logs, and design artefacts capture telemetry IDs so ETL/Looker build can proceed. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 34 | 32 | 28 | 29 | 26 | 22 | 30 | Backend Vitest suites now cover service purchase rollback + contract schemas, Playwright-ready React telemetry tests run via Vitest + Testing Library, and Flutter widget automation guards live feed banners; chaos simulations validated transaction rollback so focus shifts to load drill orchestration and compliance evidence collation. |

### Next Review Actions
- Stand up analytics ETL ingestion against the unified `analytics_events` table, including retention/backfill strategy and Looker model updates leveraging event domain/entity metadata.
- Design and implement provider/admin campaign manager UI consuming `/api/campaigns` (targeting editor, pacing timeline, billing drawer) with QA selectors and accessibility copy captured in updated drawings.
- Stand up finance operations runbook for campaign billing: map invoice approval workflow, reconciliation exports, and Slack/email notifications for overspend/late payment alerts.
- Extend communications notification backlog with webhook delivery receipts, push badge parity, and escalated quiet-hour breach alerts for ops review.
- Finalise knowledge-base articles covering communications consent, AI assist transparency, and Agora troubleshooting before broad rollout.
- Execute accessibility/localisation sweeps across dashboards and business fronts, capturing communications workspace audit outcomes (voice-over, localisation, keyboard traps) before Milestone M4 exit.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, and CI/CD workflows document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, rollback rehearsals, and accountability so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 97 | Inventory, rental, compliance, and now campaign manager specifications mirror backend payloads with provider/admin dashboards updated; mobilisation roadmap locks blueprint refresh checkpoints while microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 92 | Campaign manager copy decks (targeting guidance, pacing alerts, billing notifications) join insured seller badge, rental escalation, and fraud alert messaging; legal/comms review now spans ads billing disclosures. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 93 | Telemetry, compliance, and campaign manager UI docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats and pacing views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 97 | Filter validation, stats payload, mobilisation RACI, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow couples design regression suites with gitleaks + dependency audits; rollback manifest/playbook codify checksum verification for design-impacting releases. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 97 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, diagnostics-ready snapshot feed, and campaign manager workflows (targeting editor, pacing timeline, billing drawer) deliver analytics + monetisation pipelines with governed UX. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 94 | Inventory console, rental timelines, insured badge toggles, and campaign manager dashboards now detail empty/error states, pacing thresholds, and invoice escalation flows enabling provider/admin walkthroughs with accessibility and analytics hooks. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 96 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, diagnostics stats, ThemeProvider regression, Flutter live feed widgets, and CI-enforced lint/test gates across web/mobile/Node pipelines. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; CI/CD workflows enforce regression gates while release packaging + rollback drills add post-deploy verification hooks. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **98** | Telemetry ecosystem and mobilisation governance now extend into CI/CD, packaging, and rollback playbooks; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
