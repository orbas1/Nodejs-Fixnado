# Update Progress Tracker â€” Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 82 | Core blueprints implemented with shared primitives; attention turns to complex data viz and motion. |
| Design Organisation | 86 | Blueprint documentation and navigation anchors published for engineering; Storybook linkage planned. |
| Design Position | 78 | Home, admin, provider, and marketing layouts now conform to 12-column grid; remaining microsites scheduled Sprint 4. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Compliance copy surfaced in-page with localisation rollout notes; pending legal review for Spanish variants. |
| Design Colour Grade | 82 | Marketing modules align with tokenised palette; emo validation remains on Sprint 4 roadmap. |
| Design Render Grade | 68 | Production implementations plus high-fidelity mocks exist; animation polish pending. |
| Compliance Grade | 80 | Compliance artefacts (escrow steps, document expiries) embedded across pages; legal audit underway. |
| Security Grade | 72 | Security prompts, automation backlogs, and instrumentation documented; backend threat model alignment open. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 74 | Blueprint instrumentation covers key interactions; provider edge cases in progress. |
| Design Images Grade | 68 | Marketing imagery references approved sets; optimisation pipeline validation queued with performance team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 72 | Persona-led navigation reduces bounce; usability follow-up scheduled Sprint 4. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 82 | Accessibility smoke tests pass on recomposed pages; monitor nightly regression. |
| Test Grade | 70 | Analytics and blueprint instrumentation shipping; expand visual regression to new components. |
| QA Grade | 74 | QA handoff packs updated; marketing walkthrough video pending recording. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 78 | Blueprint documentation links UI modules to spec IDs; provider delta audit underway. |
| **Overall Grade** | **78** | Core blueprints recomposed with compliance overlays; focus shifts to motion and component expansion. |

### Next Steps
- Validate analytics events from recomposed pages in Looker dashboards and raise gaps with data team.
- Prepare Storybook stories for `PageHeader` and `BlueprintSection`, wiring into visual regression.
- Execute localisation review for Spanish (MX) marketing copy ahead of Sprint 4 roll-out.
- Plan motion studies and QA scripts for analytics widgets to close remaining render gaps.
