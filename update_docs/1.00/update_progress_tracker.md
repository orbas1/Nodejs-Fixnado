# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 92 | Validation playbook delivered with aria-live enhancements and QA selectors, reinforcing parity between specs and implementation. |
| Design Organisation | 93 | All validation artefacts centralised under `design_validation_and_handoff.md` with supporting exports for QA + engineering. |
| Design Position | 88 | Coverage now spans admin, auth, marketing, and mobile blueprints; residual microsites scheduled Sprint 4 using shared checklist template. |
| Design Text Grade | 82 | Compliance copy matrix refreshed for emo marketing variant; legal review cadence (Feb 7) recorded. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepped with fallback gradients captured in token export. |
| Design Render Grade | 88 | Marketing previews instrumented for Chromatic capture once Storybook uplift lands. |
| Compliance Grade | 92 | Governance cadence documented (3–12 Feb) ensuring accessibility, legal, and usability checkpoints executed. |
| Security Grade | 82 | Telemetry schema + beacon payload commitments documented; ingestion verification booked with data engineering. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 90 | Theme toggles broadcast deterministic telemetry and aria-live updates enabling automated validation. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Emo imagery guardrails + CDN validation backlog logged alongside marketing/legal owners. |
| Design Usability Grade | 87 | Remote usability study scripts incorporate new announcer guidance and personalisation discoverability checks. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 89 | Deterministic QA selectors reduce flaky automation; aria-live instrumentation prevents assistive tech regressions. |
| Test Grade | 86 | QA scenario export (`ui-qa-scenarios.csv`) feeds Playwright/Maestro; axe-core automation queued next sprint. |
| QA Grade | 90 | Validation cadence (desk check, accessibility audit, legal review, usability, handoff readout) confirmed with accountable owners. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 90 | Checklist items mapped to blueprint IDs and telemetry schema for traceability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **91** | Validation, QA, and handoff deliverables complete; focus shifts to automated visual regression and telemetry monitoring ahead of launch gate. |

### Next Steps
- Execute telemetry ingestion validation with data engineering (12 Feb) and publish Looker dashboard for `theme_change` events.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and marketing modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications.
