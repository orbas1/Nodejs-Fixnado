# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 35 | 30 | 25 | 28 | 30 | 20 | 28 | Governance forums and CI/CD upgrades underway; defect intake automation pending completion of tracker webhook. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 70 | 90 | 86 | 88 | 80 | 82 | 86 | Zones + bookings deployed with PostGIS-ready geometry, finance engine, analytics snapshots, and Vitest suites covering polygons, SLA timers, bids, and disputes. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 28 | 18 | 15 | 17 | 20 | 12 | 18 | Inventory ledger design ready; compliance policies for insured sellers scheduled for Week 3 workshop. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 26 | 16 | 14 | 15 | 18 | 10 | 17 | React explorer wireframes approved; Flutter parity backlog prioritised with comms integration dependencies flagged. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 24 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 16 | 9 | 15 | Event schema draft circulated; governance council reviewing retention requirements before ETL updates begin. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 34 | 32 | 28 | 29 | 26 | 22 | 30 | Backend Vitest suites now cover service purchase rollback + contract schemas, Playwright-ready React telemetry tests run via Vitest + Testing Library, and Flutter widget automation guards live feed banners; chaos simulations validated transaction rollback so focus shifts to load drill orchestration and compliance evidence collation. |

### Next Review Actions
- Link React + Flutter inventory dashboards to the new ledger/rental endpoints, ensuring low-stock, reservation, and settlement states mirror `dashboard_drawings.md` and provider app wireframes.
- Surface marketplace analytics snapshots (inventory runway, campaign pacing, fraud alerts) inside admin telemetry panels and BI pipelines before opening provider storefront beta.
- Wire React provider/admin dashboards to new inventory health, rental SLA, and campaign pacing specs documented on 11 Feb so UI parity lands before marketplace beta.
- Finalise insured seller badge copy, rental agreement templates, and compliance reminder cadences so legal/ops sign-off precedes storefront launch.
- Extend chaos and performance drills to cover inventory reservations, rental pickup spikes, and campaign overspend anomalies alongside existing booking scenarios.
- Document notification + escalation flows for inventory low stock, rental disputes, and campaign fraud alerts to feed Milestone M4 readiness packs.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 98 | Telemetry runbook, QA scenarios, and trackers document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, and rehearsal cadence so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 95 | Marketplace inventory, rental, and campaign specs now mirror backend payloads with provider/admin dashboards updated; microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 90 | Added insured seller badge copy, rental escalation messaging, and fraud alert microcopy to design artefacts; legal/comms follow-up shifted to include marketplace tone review. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 92 | Telemetry UI + diagnostics docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 96 | Filter validation, stats payload, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 92 | Additional filter validation and stats echoing protect against malformed queries while preserving audit trails. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 96 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, and diagnostics-ready snapshot feed deliver the analytics pipeline with auto-refresh, pagination, and governance workflows. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 92 | Inventory console flows, rental timelines, and badge toggles documented with error/edge cases enabling UX walkthroughs aligned to provider/admin dashboards. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 95 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, diagnostics stats, ThemeProvider regression, and Flutter live feed widgets with rehearsal evidence captured in QA scenarios. |
| QA Grade | 95 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; Slack/Looker rehearsal locked for 12 Feb with diagnostics sign-off criteria documented. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **97** | Telemetry ecosystem production-ready across ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and diagnostics; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
