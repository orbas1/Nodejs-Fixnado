# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Compliance evidence pack finalised: refreshed DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline document hashed-IP governance, Secrets Manager TTL enforcement, and JIT workflows mapped to design drawings. Task 1 exits Milestone M1 with regulator-ready artefacts and action tracker feeding future audits. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 32 | 22 | 18 | 20 | 24 | 15 | 22 | Zone service scaffolding and booking workflow specs drafted; implementation waits on security review of geo utilities. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 88 | 86 | 84 | 87 | 78 | 82 | 84 | Campaign manager stack is live: `/api/campaigns` delivers campaign CRUD, flight allocation, pacing ingestion, overspend governance, and invoice generation backed by new models/migration (`AdCampaign`, `CampaignFlight`, `CampaignTargetingRule`, `CampaignInvoice`, `CampaignDailyMetric`, `20250219000000-create-campaign-manager.js`). Service layer enforces insured seller eligibility, targeting caps, and billing reconciliation while Vitest suite `tests/campaignRoutes.test.js` exercises multi-day pacing, overspend pauses, invoice issuance, and summary listings. Backend/database/design documentation (change logs, trackers, screens, logic flows, dashboard specs) now reference campaign targeting, pacing, and billing states so monetisation flows can progress to front-end delivery, analytics warehousing, and finance runbook rehearsal without ambiguity. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 26 | 16 | 14 | 15 | 18 | 10 | 17 | React explorer wireframes approved; Flutter parity backlog prioritised with comms integration dependencies flagged. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 24 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 16 | 9 | 15 | Event schema draft circulated; governance council reviewing retention requirements before ETL updates begin. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 34 | 32 | 28 | 29 | 26 | 22 | 30 | Backend Vitest suites now cover service purchase rollback + contract schemas, Playwright-ready React telemetry tests run via Vitest + Testing Library, and Flutter widget automation guards live feed banners; chaos simulations validated transaction rollback so focus shifts to load drill orchestration and compliance evidence collation. |

### Next Review Actions
- Wire campaign pacing metrics and invoice events into analytics warehouse planning (Task 3.5) so fraud/finance dashboards can visualise spend burn, ROI, and overdue balances.
- Design and implement provider/admin campaign manager UI consuming `/api/campaigns` (targeting editor, pacing timeline, billing drawer) with QA selectors and accessibility copy captured in updated drawings.
- Stand up finance operations runbook for campaign billing: map invoice approval workflow, reconciliation exports, and Slack/email notifications for overspend/late payment alerts.
- Extend fraud monitoring backlog with campaign heuristics (abrupt spend spikes, under-delivery) and document signals required for alerting jobs.
- Finalise knowledge-base articles covering campaign eligibility, targeting best practice, billing policies, and escalation contacts prior to beta rollout.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, and CI/CD workflows document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, rollback rehearsals, and accountability so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 97 | Inventory, rental, compliance, and now campaign manager specifications mirror backend payloads with provider/admin dashboards updated; mobilisation roadmap locks blueprint refresh checkpoints while microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 92 | Campaign manager copy decks (targeting guidance, pacing alerts, billing notifications) join insured seller badge, rental escalation, and fraud alert messaging; legal/comms review now spans ads billing disclosures. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 93 | Telemetry, compliance, and campaign manager UI docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats and pacing views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 97 | Filter validation, stats payload, mobilisation RACI, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow couples design regression suites with gitleaks + dependency audits; rollback manifest/playbook codify checksum verification for design-impacting releases. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 97 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, diagnostics-ready snapshot feed, and campaign manager workflows (targeting editor, pacing timeline, billing drawer) deliver analytics + monetisation pipelines with governed UX. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 94 | Inventory console, rental timelines, insured badge toggles, and campaign manager dashboards now detail empty/error states, pacing thresholds, and invoice escalation flows enabling provider/admin walkthroughs with accessibility and analytics hooks. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 96 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, diagnostics stats, ThemeProvider regression, Flutter live feed widgets, and CI-enforced lint/test gates across web/mobile/Node pipelines. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; CI/CD workflows enforce regression gates while release packaging + rollback drills add post-deploy verification hooks. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **98** | Telemetry ecosystem and mobilisation governance now extend into CI/CD, packaging, and rollback playbooks; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
