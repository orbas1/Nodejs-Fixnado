# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Compliance evidence pack finalised: refreshed DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline document hashed-IP governance, Secrets Manager TTL enforcement, and JIT workflows mapped to design drawings. Task 1 exits Milestone M1 with regulator-ready artefacts and action tracker feeding future audits. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 32 | 22 | 18 | 20 | 24 | 15 | 22 | Zone service scaffolding and booking workflow specs drafted; implementation waits on security review of geo utilities. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 82 | 74 | 72 | 74 | 66 | 70 | 73 | Insured seller enforcement now production-grade: `/api/compliance` persists document submissions, approvals, badge toggles, and suspensions while `/api/marketplace` moderates listings with compliance snapshots and feed filtering so only approved, in-date sellers surface. Migration `20250218000000-compliance-and-marketplace-moderation.js`, new models (`ComplianceDocument`, `InsuredSellerApplication`, `MarketplaceModerationAction`), services, and Vitest coverage (`tests/complianceMarketplace.test.js`) prove blocked unverified sellers, moderation queue payloads, expiry-driven feed suppression, and suspension gating. Design artefacts (`Screens_Update.md`, `Dashboard Designs.md`, drawings) now outline badge manager states, compliance rail copy, and moderation workflows powering provider/admin consoles. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 26 | 16 | 14 | 15 | 18 | 10 | 17 | React explorer wireframes approved; Flutter parity backlog prioritised with comms integration dependencies flagged. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 24 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 16 | 9 | 15 | Event schema draft circulated; governance council reviewing retention requirements before ETL updates begin. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 34 | 32 | 28 | 29 | 26 | 22 | 30 | Backend Vitest suites now cover service purchase rollback + contract schemas, Playwright-ready React telemetry tests run via Vitest + Testing Library, and Flutter widget automation guards live feed banners; chaos simulations validated transaction rollback so focus shifts to load drill orchestration and compliance evidence collation. |

### Next Review Actions
- Stand up compliance expiry alerting (Slack + email) sourcing `InsuredSellerApplication` thresholds and document renewal windows; document runbook entries for ops/legal escalation.
- Ship provider/admin moderation UI consuming new `/api/compliance` + `/api/marketplace` payloads (badge manager, moderation queue, compliance rail) with QA selectors and accessibility copy from updated drawings.
- Extend analytics/warehouse planning to ingest insured seller metrics (approval rate, renewal lead time, suspension count) and wire dashboards to fraud/finance telemetry (Task 3.5 dependency).
- Publish support/knowledge-base articles covering insured badge requirements, document upload guidance, and moderation SLAs, linking from admin/provider consoles.
- Coordinate legal/marketing review of insured seller copy, badge placement, and moderation messaging before campaign manager build kicks off.
- Close follow-up action on rental document purge automation by confirming compliance retention timelines now that suspension/purge flows map to `/api/compliance` events.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, and CI/CD workflows document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, rollback rehearsals, and accountability so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 95 | Marketplace inventory, rental, and campaign specs now mirror backend payloads with provider/admin dashboards updated; mobilisation roadmap locks blueprint refresh checkpoints while microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 90 | Added insured seller badge copy, rental escalation messaging, and fraud alert microcopy to design artefacts; legal/comms follow-up shifted to include marketplace tone review. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 92 | Telemetry UI + diagnostics docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 97 | Filter validation, stats payload, mobilisation RACI, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow couples design regression suites with gitleaks + dependency audits; rollback manifest/playbook codify checksum verification for design-impacting releases. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 96 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, and diagnostics-ready snapshot feed deliver the analytics pipeline with auto-refresh, pagination, and governance workflows. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 92 | Inventory console flows, rental timelines, and badge toggles documented with error/edge cases enabling UX walkthroughs aligned to provider/admin dashboards. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 96 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, diagnostics stats, ThemeProvider regression, Flutter live feed widgets, and CI-enforced lint/test gates across web/mobile/Node pipelines. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; CI/CD workflows enforce regression gates while release packaging + rollback drills add post-deploy verification hooks. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **98** | Telemetry ecosystem and mobilisation governance now extend into CI/CD, packaging, and rollback playbooks; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
