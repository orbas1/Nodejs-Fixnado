# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Compliance evidence pack finalised: refreshed DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline document hashed-IP governance, Secrets Manager TTL enforcement, and JIT workflows mapped to design drawings. Task 1 exits Milestone M1 with regulator-ready artefacts and action tracker feeding future audits. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 32 | 22 | 18 | 20 | 24 | 15 | 22 | Zone service scaffolding and booking workflow specs drafted; implementation waits on security review of geo utilities. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 96 | 100 | 98 | 99 | 95 | 98 | 98 | Monetisation telemetry now streams into the analytics warehouse via `CampaignAnalyticsExport` outbox + exporter job, while `CampaignFraudSignal` catalogues overspend/underspend/CTR/CVR/delivery gap/no-spend anomalies. `/api/campaigns` exposes targeting replacement, metrics ingestion, fraud listing/resolution, and KPI summary endpoints; `campaignService.js` computes CTR/CVR/anomaly scores and manages export retries. Vitest suites (`tests/campaignRoutes.test.js`, `tests/campaignAnalyticsJob.test.js`) assert outbox creation, anomaly detection/resolution, exporter retry/backoff, and API key header wiring. Documentation (backend/database/design change logs, trackers, drawings) now details analytics export tiles, fraud anomaly rails, notification flows, and mobile parity so finance/fraud ops have governed UX + runbooks, marking Task 3 production-complete. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Accessibility/localisation sweep delivered locale provider with persisted preferences, HTML `lang/dir` updates, and translation catalogues spanning header, dashboards, and business fronts. Provider/enterprise panels now expose translated copy, aria-live alerts, skip navigation, and Suspense fallbacks while business fronts inherit currency/date/percentage formatting and concierge support messaging. Documentation, design artefacts, trackers, and frontend changelogs capture localisation rules, accessibility scripts, QA selectors, pseudo-locale stress guidance, and performance budgets, marking Task 4 production-complete. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 96 | 97 | 95 | 96 | 92 | 95 | 96 | Flutter analytics parity landed with `AnalyticsDashboardScreen` consuming the governed `/api/analytics/dashboards/:persona` contracts through a cached Riverpod controller. Mobile UI now mirrors web metrics, charts, rental tables, workflow boards, and settings panels while CSV export flows persist metadata for governance. Vitest/Riverpod tests validate offline fallbacks and export handling; documentation, drawings, and trackers updated so remaining scope focuses on enterprise drill-down insights and alerting automation. Update index refreshed on 2 Nov to capture the Flutter artefacts and keep traceability complete. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 52 | 48 | 46 | 47 | 42 | 40 | 46 | Performance harness established: `npm run load:test` now drives a governed k6 suite (`performance/k6/main.js`, `performance/profiles/baseline.json`) exercising booking, chat/Agora, escrow purchases, persona analytics, and campaign telemetry with success-rate/latency thresholds and summary exports. `scripts/run-load-tests.mjs` validates JWT/env prerequisites, streams summary JSON into `performance/reports/`, and refuses to run without k6/token prerequisites while `performance/README.md` captures staging rehearsal guidance; trackers log upcoming soak/chaos extensions alongside compliance dry-runs. |

### Next Review Actions
- Schedule staging soak test leveraging the k6 harness with production-like data to validate sustained concurrency before locking Iteration B exit criteria.
- Run GDPR/insurance/HMRC dry-run audits (Task 6.4) using updated performance evidence and load drill outputs as part of compliance rehearsal sign-off.
- Extend communications notification backlog with webhook delivery receipts, push badge parity, and escalated quiet-hour breach alerts for ops review.
- Finalise knowledge-base articles covering communications consent, AI assist transparency, and Agora troubleshooting before broad rollout.
- Execute accessibility/localisation sweeps across dashboards and business fronts, capturing communications workspace audit outcomes (voice-over, localisation, keyboard traps) before Milestone M4 exit.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, and CI/CD workflows document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, rollback rehearsals, and accountability so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 97 | Inventory, rental, compliance, and now campaign manager specifications mirror backend payloads with provider/admin dashboards updated; mobilisation roadmap locks blueprint refresh checkpoints while microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 92 | Campaign manager copy decks (targeting guidance, pacing alerts, billing notifications) join insured seller badge, rental escalation, and fraud alert messaging; legal/comms review now spans ads billing disclosures. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 93 | Telemetry, compliance, and campaign manager UI docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats and pacing views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 97 | Filter validation, stats payload, mobilisation RACI, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow couples design regression suites with gitleaks + dependency audits; rollback manifest/playbook codify checksum verification for design-impacting releases. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 97 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, diagnostics-ready snapshot feed, and campaign manager workflows (targeting editor, pacing timeline, billing drawer) deliver analytics + monetisation pipelines with governed UX. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 94 | Inventory console, rental timelines, insured badge toggles, and campaign manager dashboards now detail empty/error states, pacing thresholds, and invoice escalation flows enabling provider/admin walkthroughs with accessibility and analytics hooks. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 96 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, diagnostics stats, ThemeProvider regression, Flutter live feed widgets, and CI-enforced lint/test gates across web/mobile/Node pipelines. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; CI/CD workflows enforce regression gates while release packaging + rollback drills add post-deploy verification hooks. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **98** | Telemetry ecosystem and mobilisation governance now extend into CI/CD, packaging, and rollback playbooks; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
