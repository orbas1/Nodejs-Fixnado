# Update Progress Tracker â€” Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 94 | Telemetry ingestion API + enriched beacons close the loop between design specs, instrumentation, and analytics dashboards. |
| Design Organisation | 94 | Validation artefacts, telemetry schema, and dashboard runbook live together (`design_validation_and_handoff.md`, `fx-theme-preferences.json`, `docs/telemetry/ui-preference-dashboard.md`). |
| Design Position | 88 | Coverage now spans admin, auth, marketing, and mobile blueprints; residual microsites scheduled Sprint 4 using shared checklist template. |
| Design Text Grade | 82 | Compliance copy matrix refreshed for emo marketing variant; legal review cadence (Feb 7) recorded. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepped with fallback gradients captured in token export. |
| Design Render Grade | 88 | Marketing previews instrumented for Chromatic capture once Storybook uplift lands. |
| Compliance Grade | 93 | Governance cadence now includes telemetry privacy controls (hashed IP, schema versioning) approved with data engineering. |
| Security Grade | 88 | Ingestion endpoint validates payloads, hashes source IPs, and records correlation IDs; security briefing queued for Week 5. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 92 | Theme toggles broadcast enriched telemetry (tenant/role/locale) with fetch fallbacks ensuring event durability. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Emo imagery guardrails + CDN validation backlog logged alongside marketing/legal owners. |
| Design Usability Grade | 87 | Remote usability study scripts incorporate new announcer guidance and personalisation discoverability checks. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 90 | QA selectors plus telemetry persistence reduce blind spots in automation diagnostics and regression triage. |
| Test Grade | 88 | QA scenario export (`ui-qa-scenarios.csv`) now covers ingestion and analytics summary endpoints, expanding automated coverage. |
| QA Grade | 91 | Data engineering joined cadence; telemetry dashboards added to release-readiness gating. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 92 | Telemetry schema + dashboard runbook ensure implementation fidelity to governance requirements. |
| **Overall Grade** | **93** | Validation suite plus telemetry ingestion/dashboards ready; attention shifts to Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Operationalise telemetry dashboards with analytics (Looker refresh schedule, alerting) ahead of pilot release (Week 5).
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and marketing modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications.
