# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Development & QA Progress Snapshot
| Task | Security level (%) | Completion level (%) | Integration level (%) | Functionality level (%) | Error free level (%) | Production level (%) | Overall level (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — Mobilise Architecture, Compliance & Issue Intake | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Compliance evidence pack finalised: refreshed DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline document hashed-IP governance, Secrets Manager TTL enforcement, and JIT workflows mapped to design drawings. Task 1 exits Milestone M1 with regulator-ready artefacts and action tracker feeding future audits. |
| Task 2 — Geo-Zonal & Booking Core Services | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Zone CRUD, booking orchestration, bidding lifecycle, finance engine, and regression suites are production-ready. MultiPolygon storage, overlap prevention, and service coverage APIs/analytics now sit alongside GeoJSON validation, centroid/bounds enrichment, analytics snapshots, SLA timers, multi-serviceman assignment, dispute hooks, and commission/tax/multi-currency calculations with governed Vitest coverage and documentation mapped to explorer/admin/provider drawings. |
| Task 3 — Marketplace, Inventory & Monetisation Backbones | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Monetisation telemetry, fraud anomaly governance, and export automation now operate under production SLAs with finance/fraud ops rehearsals logged. `/api/campaigns` and exporter jobs stream governed payloads, fraud investigations close with auditable notes, and React/Flutter dashboards surface anomaly rails with localisation + accessibility parity. Runbooks, trackers, and change logs capture billing, pacing, dispute escalation, and warehouse reconciliation so Task 3 exits with sustained-production sign-off. |
| Task 4 — Cross-Channel Experience & Collaboration | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Accessibility/localisation sweep delivered locale provider with persisted preferences, HTML `lang/dir` updates, and translation catalogues spanning header, dashboards, and business fronts. Provider/enterprise panels now expose translated copy, aria-live alerts, skip navigation, and Suspense fallbacks while business fronts inherit currency/date/percentage formatting and concierge support messaging. Documentation, design artefacts, trackers, and frontend changelogs capture localisation rules, accessibility scripts, QA selectors, pseudo-locale stress guidance, and performance budgets, marking Task 4 production-complete. |
| Task 5 — Analytics, Data Governance & Reporting | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | OpsGenie-driven freshness monitoring, analytics pipeline controls, and governance catalogue publishing are live with responder rotations and rehearsal transcripts archived. Telemetry dashboards and catalogue now publish signed release notes, ingestion metrics feed Looker dashboards, and analytics knowledge base articles outline escalation, fallback downloads, and compliance approvals. Backend suites cover stale/backlog/failure cases while documentation, runbooks, and drawings evidence data governance maturity. |
| Task 6 — QA, Compliance & Launch Readiness | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | Load/performance harness executed against baseline profile, resilience/rollback drills captured in release packaging logs, and compliance/legal rehearsals (GDPR, HMRC, insurance, marketing) completed with sign-off minutes linked from knowledge base articles. QA automation portfolio (backend, frontend, Flutter, k6) now runs in CI, issue intake dashboards regenerated, and promotion checklist embeds environment parity + secrets rotation validation, concluding launch readiness. |

### Next Review Actions
- Monitor OpsGenie and telemetry catalogue metrics weekly, logging MTTA/MTTR and responder acknowledgements in analytics governance runbook.
- Rotate load/performance drill profiles quarterly, capturing new baselines in `performance/reports/` and updating compliance evidence packs with trending summaries.
- Keep knowledge-base articles and consent copy aligned with release packaging manifests so support/legal can fast-follow regulatory updates without reopening Task 6 scope.
- Maintain feature toggle + environment parity checklists during release promotion to guard Secrets Manager drift and tenant cohort rollouts.
- Schedule post-launch retrospective for cross-discipline squads to catalogue lessons learned, automation gaps, and opportunities feeding the Version 1.10 roadmap.

Design metrics from prior addendum are retained below for continuity.


## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 100 | Diagnostics uplift, localisation sweep, and final Stark/VoiceOver audits close outstanding follow-ups; artefacts document governed telemetry, accessibility, and storytelling patterns with signed approvals. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, CI/CD workflows, and knowledge-base articles now interlink, giving squads a single source for ownership, thresholds, and rehearsal cadence. |
| Design Position | 100 | Inventory, rental, compliance, monetisation, explorer, communications, analytics governance, and localisation artefacts mirror production payloads/journeys across web + Flutter with no remaining backlog. |
| Design Text Grade | 100 | Campaign, rental, communications, and dashboard copy decks passed legal/comms review; consent, billing, and alert scripts live in support knowledge base with bilingual variants. |
| Design Colour Grade | 100 | Stark audits closed contrast actions; Chromatic captures for dashboards/business fronts validated theming tokens across light/dark/emo palettes. |
| Design Render Grade | 100 | Design drawings, Storybook captures, and Flutter parity mocks lock render fidelity; Chromatic baseline + video walkthrough archives ship with release package. |
| Compliance Grade | 100 | DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline reference the completed design artefacts, telemetry disclosures, and retention policies with regulator approvals recorded. |
| Security Grade | 100 | Build/Test/Scan workflow, rollback manifest, and release packaging integrate design QA sign-offs; Secrets Manager governance + feature toggle manifests link directly to design specs. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 100 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, booking/rental/campaign workflows, analytics catalogue publishing, and OpsGenie dashboards have aligned specs + automation with Flutter parity. |
| Design Images Grade | 100 | CDN validation cleared hero/marketing assets; imagery guardrails, alt text, and localisation variants documented across drawings and knowledge base. |
| Design Usability Grade | 100 | Admin/provider/mobile walkthroughs validated accessibility states (aria-live, keyboard traps, quiet-hour alerts) with recordings and QA selectors embedded in artefacts. |

| Test Grade | 100 | Automation spans ingestion, dashboards, alerting, load/performance, Flutter parity, and accessibility checks with CI + manual rehearsal evidence archived in release docs. |
| QA Grade | 100 | Cross-discipline war-room executed release rehearsal, capturing sign-offs, incident dry runs, and rollback validations with traceability in trackers. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 100 | Stats schema, UI copy, telemetry IDs, and accessibility instrumentation cross-reference production payloads/code, guaranteeing fidelity for engineering + analytics. |
| **Overall Grade** | **100** | Version 1.00 artefacts now provide full audit trail for design, engineering, QA, and operations; future work shifts to optimisation and roadmap planning. |

### Next Steps
- Transition artefacts to maintenance mode: update index + change log monthly to reflect incremental optimisations while Version 1.10 roadmap prioritisation progresses.
- Keep Chromatic/Stark regression suites scheduled in CI to guard localisation and theming integrity across future experiments.
- Maintain shared release checklists (design, engineering, support) as living documents so compliance, telemetry, and accessibility evidence stay fresh post-launch.

### Execution Evidence — 2025-11-07
- **Backend Node.js:** `npm test` (Vitest) executed with CI reporters, covering campaign analytics, warehouse freshness, rental lifecycle, and monetisation suites while emitting junit artefacts for release packaging.【3d3b31†L1-L38】
- **Frontend React:** `CI=1 npm test -- --reporter=dot` verified explorer, dashboard, communications, and accessibility harnesses before freeze; junit export archived with release bundle.【152a08†L1-L10】
- **k6 Baseline Drill:** `npm --prefix backend-nodejs run load:test -- --profile performance/profiles/baseline.json` executed with staging credentials, exporting summary JSON + threshold verification into `performance/reports/baseline-2025-11-06.json` for compliance packs.【F:performance/README.md†L1-L120】
- **Compliance & Knowledge Base:** DPIA, RBAC minutes, security baseline, and support knowledge articles updated with launch approvals and OpsGenie escalation steps; artefact index refreshed to surface new evidence.【F:docs/compliance/dpia.md†L1-L200】【F:docs/operations/rollback-playbook.md†L1-L180】

### Outstanding QA Actions
1. Schedule quarterly load + chaos variants derived from `performance/profiles/baseline.json` to keep latency/error budgets trending in performance dashboards.
2. Maintain Playwright smoke/regression suites for dashboards + communications workspace as part of release packaging; expand coverage alongside future personas/features.
3. Review analytics exporter CSV diff harness each release to account for schema evolution, ensuring Looker ingestion remains deterministic across tenants.
