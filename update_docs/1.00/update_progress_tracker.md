# Update Progress Tracker â€” Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 96 | Telemetry dashboard + alerting job complete the governed analytics loop; KPI widgets and Slack notifications align to design drawings and operational scripts. |
| Design Organisation | 96 | Alerting dossier, snapshot schema, and QA scenarios sit alongside validation artefacts, giving operations, design, and analytics a single reference stack with escalation steps. |
| Design Position | 90 | Coverage now spans admin, auth, marketing, telemetry, and mobile blueprints; residual microsites scheduled Sprint 4 using shared checklist template. |
| Design Text Grade | 84 | Compliance copy matrix refreshed for emo marketing variant; alert copy approved by legal/comms with 7 Feb review locked. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepped with fallback gradients captured in token export. |
| Design Render Grade | 90 | Telemetry console reuses analytics widgets with production theming; Chromatic capture queued for Theme Studio + telemetry module set. |
| Compliance Grade | 94 | Governance cadence now includes telemetry privacy controls, alert escalation policy, and snapshot retention guidance agreed with data engineering. |
| Security Grade | 90 | Ingestion endpoint and alerting job validate payloads, hash source IPs, suppress repeat notifications, and surface failures for Week 5 security review. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 94 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, and alerting pipeline broadcast enriched payloads with auto-refresh, snapshots, and Slack escalation resilience. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Emo imagery guardrails + CDN validation backlog logged alongside marketing/legal owners. |
| Design Usability Grade | 89 | Telemetry dashboard follows accessibility patterns (segmented control, status messaging) and now surfaces alert context for admin comprehension. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 92 | Deterministic telemetry selectors, auto-refresh hook, and alert repeat suppression minimise regression blind spots in analytics monitoring. |
| Test Grade | 91 | QA scenarios include ingestion handshake, telemetry dashboard validation, and alerting harness checks across Playwright/Cypress suites. |
| QA Grade | 93 | Data engineering + design ops review telemetry UI weekly; dashboard and alert SLAs tracked in readiness gates. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 93 | Telemetry schema, alert thresholds, and snapshot payload documented in runbooks ensuring implementation fidelity to governance requirements. |
| **Overall Grade** | **95** | Validation suite, telemetry ingestion/console, and alerting pipeline ready; focus shifts to Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Enable Looker ingestion using the telemetry snapshot table and rehearse Slack alert escalation with analytics/ops (target 12 Feb review).
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
