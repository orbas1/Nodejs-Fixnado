# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift extends the governed telemetry loop — instrumentation, dashboards, alerting, and BI diagnostics now operate on curated assets with stats coverage. |
| Design Organisation | 98 | Telemetry runbook, QA scenarios, and trackers document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, and rehearsal cadence so ops/design/data operate from a shared governance script. |
| Design Position | 93 | Admin, auth, marketing, telemetry, and mobile blueprints live; analytics diagnostics close data-quality gaps with microsite uplift scheduled for Sprint 4. |
| Design Text Grade | 86 | Compliance copy matrix incorporates diagnostics messaging (freshness thresholds, override guidance); legal/comms review still targeted for 7 Feb. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 92 | Telemetry UI + diagnostics docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once stats views recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 96 | Filter validation, stats payload, and rehearsal checklist document retention/freshness policy ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 92 | Additional filter validation and stats echoing protect against malformed queries while preserving audit trails. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 96 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, and diagnostics-ready snapshot feed deliver the analytics pipeline with auto-refresh, pagination, and governance workflows. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 90 | Ops rehearsal scripts now include diagnostics walkthroughs so teams can evidence freshness governance during drills; usability audits scheduled post-rehearsal. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; QA asserts stale bounds and stats payload structure. |
| Test Grade | 93 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and diagnostics stats with staging rehearsal captured in QA scenarios. |
| QA Grade | 95 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; Slack/Looker rehearsal locked for 12 Feb with diagnostics sign-off criteria documented. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema + API contract updates documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity and auditability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **97** | Telemetry ecosystem production-ready across ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and diagnostics; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off (including diagnostics stats validation) recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
