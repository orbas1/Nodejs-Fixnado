# Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00

## Portfolio Overview
- Non-design progress metrics continue to be tracked in their respective artefacts (backend, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

## UI/UX Design Metrics Addendum
| Metric | Status (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 97 | Snapshot API plus runbook refresh closes the analytics loop — telemetry instrumentation, dashboard, alerting, and BI ingestion now operate on governed assets. |
| Design Organisation | 97 | Telemetry documentation, QA scenarios, and trackers host ingestion + rehearsal notes alongside validation artefacts, ensuring ops/design/data share a single playbook. |
| Design Position | 92 | Admin, auth, marketing, telemetry, and mobile blueprints live; analytics distribution ready with residual microsites scheduled for Sprint 4 uplift. |
| Design Text Grade | 85 | Compliance copy matrix covers snapshot onboarding + Slack alert messaging; legal/comms review still targeted for 7 Feb. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; Chromatic baselines queued to lock telemetry states next sprint. |
| Design Render Grade | 91 | Telemetry UI + ingestion docs reuse governed theming; Chromatic capture planned once rehearsal state variations recorded. |
| Compliance Grade | 95 | Snapshot API enforces hashed IPs + retention guidance, and rehearsal checklist aligns analytics/ops sign-offs ahead of 12 Feb review. |
| Security Grade | 91 | API validation, cursor controls, and hashed network data extend telemetry security posture; infosec briefing now includes BI access gating. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 95 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, and snapshot feed deliver full analytics pipeline with auto-refresh, pagination, and rehearsal workflows. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation backlog remains in Sprint 4 queue. |
| Design Usability Grade | 89 | Ops rehearsal scripts emphasise telemetry + snapshot comprehension; usability audits scheduled post-rehearsal. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 93 | Deterministic selectors plus API pagination reduce regression risk; QA asserts cursor chaining to prevent duplicate ingestion. |
| Test Grade | 92 | Automation now spans ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and snapshot feed, with staging rehearsal captured in QA scenarios. |
| QA Grade | 94 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly; Slack/Looker rehearsal set for 12 Feb with documented exit criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 94 | Snapshot payload schema + API contract documented; runbooks link to implementation to preserve fidelity. |
| **Overall Grade** | **96** | Telemetry ecosystem production-ready across ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and BI distribution; next sprint targets Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

### Next Steps
- Execute Slack alert + Looker ingestion rehearsal in staging on 12 Feb, ensuring ops + analytics sign-off recorded in runbook.
- Complete Storybook capture + Chromatic baselines for Theme Studio and telemetry dashboard modules post Sprint 4.
- Run Stark/VoiceOver audits (5 Feb) and legal/marketing sign-off (7 Feb) prior to gating release.
- Draft support/marketing ops playbook referencing validation checklist outcomes before launch communications and analytics monitoring procedures.
