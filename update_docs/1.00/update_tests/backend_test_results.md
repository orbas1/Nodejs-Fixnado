# Backend Test Results — 2025-02-09

- ✅ `npm test` *(backend-nodejs — 2025-02-09)* — Vitest suites execute against an isolated sqlite harness to validate service creation, purchase, escrow rollback, and contract schema conformance. Coverage includes chaos injection to ensure failed escrow writes leave no orphan orders. 【e72d10†L1-L27】
- ✅ `npm test` *(backend-nodejs — 2025-02-10)* — New geo-zonal + booking suites verify polygon validation, analytics snapshots, SLA timers, finance totals, assignments, bidding, and dispute flows alongside existing regression coverage. 【8d054d†L1-L20】
- ✅ `npm test` *(backend-nodejs — 2025-10-13)* — Secrets Manager-backed feature toggle service, audit logging, and Postgres bootstrap checks now run in CI via `tests/featureToggleService.test.js` alongside existing regression suites. 【ffa5b0†L1-L9】
- ⚠️ `npm --prefix backend-nodejs run load:test -- --profile performance/profiles/baseline.json` *(scheduled staging drill)* — k6 harness (`performance/k6/main.js`, `performance/README.md`) wired via `scripts/run-load-tests.mjs` with governed env validation and summary export path. Execution deferred in this container because k6 CLI is unavailable; staging rehearsal will capture summary JSON and compare against profile thresholds.
