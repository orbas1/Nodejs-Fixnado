# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-02-03)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 97 | Snapshot API plus runbook refresh gives analytics a governed ingestion path; telemetry programme now spans instrumentation, UI, alerting, and BI distribution. |
| Design Organisation | 97 | Telemetry documentation, QA scenarios, and trackers now co-own ingestion + rehearsal notes, keeping ops/design/data aligned on governance steps. |
| Design Position | 92 | Coverage extends across admin/auth/marketing/mobile with analytics distribution signed off; residual microsites remain on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 85 | Compliance tone-of-voice matrix expanded to cover snapshot alert copy and Looker onboarding messaging ahead of legal review (7 Feb). |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepared; no palette changes this sprint—focus shifts to Chromatic baselines for telemetry/state banners. |
| Design Render Grade | 91 | Telemetry dashboards + snapshot docs reference the same theming guidelines; Chromatic capture queued next sprint with refreshed ingestion states. |
| Compliance Grade | 95 | Snapshot API honours hashed IPs, schema versioning, and retention guidance; rehearsal checklist aligns analytics + ops sign-offs. |
| Security Grade | 91 | API validates inputs, enforces cursor pagination, and continues to hash network data; infosec brief extends to BI access controls. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 95 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, and snapshot feed deliver end-to-end analytics instrumentation with governed pagination + rehearsals. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation remains queued with infra. |
| Design Usability Grade | 89 | Usability study scripts now include analytics rehearsal narrative to validate ops comprehension of telemetry + snapshot tooling. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 93 | Deterministic selectors plus API pagination reduce regression surface; QA now asserts cursor chaining to catch data duplication. |
| Test Grade | 92 | QA scenarios cover ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and snapshot pagination with API verification + Slack rehearsal in staging. |
| QA Grade | 94 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE coordinate weekly—analytics rehearsal scheduled for 12 Feb with clear exit criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 94 | Snapshot payload schema, API contract, and documentation updates ensure implementation fidelity and traceability for BI integration. |
| **Overall Grade** | **96** | Telemetry ecosystem now supports instrumentation → dashboard → alerting → BI distribution; next sprint prioritises Chromatic/axe automation and tenant segmentation. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, alerting job, and `/api/telemetry/ui-preferences/snapshots` feed expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; runbook/QA now guide Looker ingestion + alert rehearsal end-to-end.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, alerting pipeline, and snapshot feed live; rehearsal now focuses on staging Slack dry run + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery requires legal approval → Legal/marketing review on 7 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, rehearse Slack + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb, and plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout alongside tenant segmentation spikes.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
