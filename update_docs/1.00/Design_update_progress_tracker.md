## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, alerting job, and diagnostics-enhanced `/api/telemetry/ui-preferences/snapshots` feed expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; runbook/QA now guide Looker ingestion, alert rehearsal, and data-quality diagnostics end-to-end.
6. **Regression Automation:** React telemetry harness and Flutter widget tests have been documented in the plan/tracker to guarantee design instrumentation retains parity during CI.
7. **Issue Intake Integration:** `scripts/issue-intake.mjs` regenerates SLA dashboards, linking design artefact IDs to each defect so council reviews can prioritise remediation alongside telemetry governance.
8. **Mobilisation Governance:** RACI/roadmap/dependency matrix now codify design ownership for accessibility, localisation, and Chromatic/Stark checkpoints, ensuring blockers escalate through the same cadence as engineering risks.
9. **Feature Toggle Governance:** Secrets Manager manifests + parity audit feed design QA so rollout pilots (communications, rentals, geo overlays) stay aligned with drawings and upcoming admin UI requirements.
10. **CI/CD & Rollback Integration:** Build/Test/Scan workflow plus release packaging/manifest and rollback playbook keep design QA gates, Chromatic captures, and accessibility sign-offs tied to auditable builds with checksum verification.
11. **Compliance Evidence Integration:** DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline now cite design drawings, consent copy, and telemetry disclosures; design backlog tracks chat consent updates, telemetry opt-out help links, and JIT banner states.
12. **Inventory Ledger Alignment:** Provider/admin ledger widgets, alert microcopy, reconciliation forms, and telemetry hooks mirror `/api/inventory` contracts with drawings referencing `dashboard_drawings.md` and `Admin_panel_drawings.md` to unblock frontend build without rework.
13. **Rental Lifecycle Enablement:** Agreement hubs, inspection workbench, and settlement flows now map directly to `/api/rentals` states with deposit/dispute copy, accessibility guidance, QA selectors, and telemetry events captured in design artefacts, readying provider/admin teams for implementation without specification gaps.
14. **Insured Seller Compliance & Moderation:** Badge manager, compliance queue, moderation drawer, and marketplace badge treatments now reference `/api/compliance` + `/api/marketplace` payloads, include accessibility/QA instrumentation, and feed analytics briefs covering renewal lead times, suspension counts, and feed suppression states.
15. **Campaign Manager Targeting, Pacing & Billing:** Campaign workspace, targeting composer, pacing analytics, and invoice drawer specs align with `/api/campaigns` responses, overspend governance, and finance reconciliation runbooks; Flutter/web parity plus telemetry schema ensure monetisation rollout is implementation-ready.
16. **Campaign Analytics Telemetry & Fraud Monitoring:** Export outbox tiles, fraud anomaly rail, ROI/CTR/CVR KPI refresh, and notification patterns now map to new analytics/fraud endpoints. Accessibility, QA selectors, and telemetry events documented for automation, finance/fraud ops, and warehouse teams.
17. **Explorer Search & Zone Intelligence:** React explorer now aligns to drawings with MapLibre overlays, demand-aware filters, SLA insight panel, and marketplace/service segmentation. API client + utilities normalise geometry for SQLite/PostGIS parity, while documentation captures telemetry, QA selectors, backlog items for booking wizard/chat/Flutter parity, and the design change log entry referencing updated drawings.
18. **Flutter Parity QA Hardening:** Controller suites for bookings/rentals validate cached refresh, offline banners, and lifecycle actions against `App_screens_drawings.md` + `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`; `_DateField` guidance updated to mirror inspection scheduling copy so rental creation sheet remains accessible and compliant.
19. **Communications Suite & Notification Centre:** Communications workspace, AI toggle governance, notification drawer flows, and Agora launch specs now link to `/api/communications` contracts (messages, deliveries, quiet-hour overrides, Agora sessions) with accessibility, telemetry, and QA selectors documented across `Design_Plan.md`, `component_functions.md`, and Flutter communications controller tests to maintain cross-channel parity.
20. **Business Front & Role Dashboards:** Header mega-menu, business front hero/storytelling, provider KPI widgets, and enterprise analytics panels mirror drawings and updated specs. React routing and panel pages reuse telemetry IDs, QA selectors, aria-live messaging, and cache-aware fallback content; follow-up actions focus on Task 4.5 accessibility/localisation audits and Flutter parity instrumentation.
21. **Unified Analytics Event Schema:** Analytics event catalogue now documented across screens with metadata tables, tenant/actor guidance, and QA selectors linked to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `website_drawings.md`. Design artefacts reference retention policy and Looker modelling plan so analytics/data ops can rehearse ingestion without specification drift.
22. **Analytics Ingestion & Quiet-Hour Telemetry:** Warehouse ingestion dashboards, retry/purge swim lanes, retention expiry chips, and quiet-hour suppression insight widgets are mapped into `dashboard_drawings.md`, `Screens_Update.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`, and `Design_Plan.md`, with support copy/runbook references ensuring analytics ops and support teams rehearse ingestion failures and suppression escalations alongside new backend capabilities.
23. **Accessibility & Localisation Hardening:** Locale provider contract, bilingual copy decks, skip-navigation flows, aria-live refresh banners, and Suspense loaders are now documented across `Design_Plan.md`, `Screens_Update.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`. QA selectors and pseudo-locale stress scripts recorded in trackers/tasks ensure accessibility and internationalisation audits are repeatable before Milestone M4 exit.
24. **Analytics Pipeline Control Console:** Admin status card, pause/resume modal, run history ledger, and analytics ops widgets are documented across `Design_Plan.md` Section 36, `Design_Change_log.md` Entry 26, `Screens_Update.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`, and updated drawings. Specifications capture Secrets Manager governance, telemetry schema (`analytics.pipeline.control`), accessibility cues, and cross-environment guidance so ops/support/legal teams can rehearse pipeline rollbacks alongside new backend controls.
25. **Persona Analytics Dashboards & CSV Export:** `Design_Plan.md` Section 37 and `Design_Change_log.md` Entry 27 document admin/provider/serviceman/enterprise dashboard tile architecture, insight copy, localisation requirements, and governed export toolbar tied to `/api/analytics/dashboards/:persona` and CSV endpoints. Drawings capture responsive layouts, skeleton/empty states, telemetry IDs (`analytics.dashboard.metric.view`, `analytics.dashboard.export`), and QA selectors so frontend, analytics ops, finance, and success teams share production-ready blueprints ahead of Task 5.3 completion.
26. **Persona Dashboard Verification (2025-10-30):** Staging walkthrough validated export toolbar copy (row limits, timezone tag, last refresh timestamp), localisation fallbacks, and CSV annotations. QA logged Vitest reporter hardening to remove spinner noise from analytics regression evidence, and drawings now include accessibility callouts (aria-live banners, keyboard shortcuts) to complete Task 5.3a readiness.
27. **Persona Dashboard Toggle Gating (2025-10-31):** Added Secrets Manager-aware gating specs across `DashboardAccessGate.jsx`, `FeatureToggleProvider.jsx`, and drawings so persona dashboards surface pilot banners, toggle summary metadata, and access request workflow with telemetry (`feature.toggle.refresh`, `feature.toggle.request_access`). Tracker commentary updated with Flutter parity notes and enterprise drill-down backlog links to evidence Task 17 Subtask 4 completion.
28. **Flutter Analytics Dashboard Parity (2025-11-02):** Mobile analytics screen specs now mirror web persona dashboards with chart treatments, sidebar badges, offline/export messaging, and telemetry IDs. Flutter implementation (`AnalyticsDashboardScreen`, chart widgets, repository/controller) plus controller tests reference `App_screens_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and updated `user_phone_app_updates` docs, closing Task 17 Subtask 3.
29. **Geo-Zonal & Booking Engine Alignment (2025-02-10):** Explorer overlays, booking wizard journeys, bidding comments, dispute drawers, and finance disclosures are now wired to `/api/zones`, `/api/bookings`, and finance metadata. Drawings (`website_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`) and specs (`Screens_Update.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`) include telemetry IDs, QA selectors, accessibility copy, and analytics governance notes, ensuring React/Flutter clients and analytics dashboards consume the production contracts delivered in Task 2.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, alerting pipeline, and snapshot feed live; rehearsal now focuses on staging Slack dry run + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb.
- **Communications Operational Risk:** Align quiet-hour schedules, escalation contacts, and AI moderation thresholds with support ops — documentation and notification drawer specs now call out configuration defaults; follow-up monitors analytics on acknowledgement latency before enterprise rollout.
- **Inventory & Rental Adoption:** Align provider/admin build with new ledger + rental specs, monitor MTTA + inspection SLA targets, and schedule usability validation of reconciliation sheet and inspection workbench prior to provider beta.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery, insured seller badge copy, and moderation messaging require legal approval → Legal/marketing review rescheduled to 22 Oct with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, rehearse Slack + Looker ingestion with diagnostics stats on 12 Feb, plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout alongside tenant segmentation spikes, walkthrough marketplace inventory, rental, communications (messages workspace, notifications, Agora launch), compliance moderation, and campaign manager modules with frontend/finance/support leads, validate provider badge manager/compliance queue/campaign pacing prototypes against new specs, and confirm compliance + finance follow-ups (chat consent copy, telemetry opt-out article, invoice escalation comms, rental document purge automation) before communications beta.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
