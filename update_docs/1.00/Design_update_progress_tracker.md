# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-02-11)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift delivers governed stats + filters so analytics can evidence freshness without SQL; telemetry ecosystem now spans instrumentation → dashboards → alerting → BI diagnostics. |
| Design Organisation | 98 | Telemetry runbook, QA scenarios, and trackers document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, and rehearsal cadence keeping ops/design/data aligned on governance steps. |
| Design Position | 96 | Marketplace inventory, rental, and campaign modules now documented with implementation-grade specs across mobile/web (`Screens_Update.md`, `Dashboard Designs.md`), completing alignment with new backend services while microsite uplift remains queued. |
| Design Text Grade | 90 | Injected insured seller copy, fraud alert CTAs, and rental escalation messaging into application + web settings/dashboard docs; legal/comms review scope extended to marketplace tone but scheduling intact. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; no palette changes this sprint—focus shifts to Chromatic baselines for telemetry/state banners. |
| Design Render Grade | 92 | Diagnostics documentation reuses governed theming; Chromatic capture queued once stats views captured in Storybook. |
| Compliance Grade | 96 | Filter validation + stats payload document retention/freshness policy and rehearsal checklist extends to diagnostics review. |
| Security Grade | 92 | Additional validation prevents malformed filters while stats echo applied parameters for audit trails. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 97 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, diagnostics-ready snapshots, and booking/zone orchestration metadata collectively fulfil design workflows end-to-end. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation remains queued with infra. |
| Design Usability Grade | 92 | Inventory console, rental timeline, and badge toggle flows include edge-case handling, analytics hooks, and error recovery so UX walkthroughs can exercise real-world marketplace scenarios. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; automation asserts stale bounds + stats payloads. |
| Test Grade | 95 | Vitest ThemeProvider regression and Flutter live feed widget suites now run alongside telemetry diagnostics coverage, securing regression evidence across web + mobile artefacts. |
| QA Grade | 95 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE share diagnostics checklist—analytics rehearsal locked for 12 Feb with data quality assertions. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema and filter validation documented alongside implementation maintain fidelity for BI integration. |
| **Overall Grade** | **97** | Telemetry ecosystem production-ready across ingestion, dashboard, alerting, and diagnostics; next sprint prioritises Chromatic/axe automation and tenant segmentation. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, alerting job, and diagnostics-enhanced `/api/telemetry/ui-preferences/snapshots` feed expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; runbook/QA now guide Looker ingestion, alert rehearsal, and data-quality diagnostics end-to-end.
6. **Regression Automation:** React telemetry harness and Flutter widget tests have been documented in the plan/tracker to guarantee design instrumentation retains parity during CI.
7. **Geo-Zonal & Booking Alignment:** Explorer overlays, booking wizard states, and finance disclosures are now backed by production APIs reflecting drawings and compliance copy, ensuring design artefacts remain source-of-truth across channels.
8. **Marketplace Alignment:** Provider inventory console, rental lifecycle, insured seller badge, and campaign pacing specs updated across mobile/web so marketplace services land with UX-ready modules and analytics hooks.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, alerting pipeline, and snapshot feed live; rehearsal now focuses on staging Slack dry run + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery and new marketplace copy require legal approval → Legal/marketing review rescheduled to 13 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, rehearse Slack + Looker ingestion with diagnostics stats on 12 Feb, plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout alongside tenant segmentation spikes, and walkthrough marketplace inventory/campaign modules with frontend leads.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
