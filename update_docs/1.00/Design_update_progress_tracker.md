# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 2 Completion)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 68 | Foundation concepts strong; need further iteration on data visualisation clarity and cross-platform parity for complex forms. |
| Design Organisation | 72 | Documentation hierarchy established; refine navigation between artefacts and improve tagging for faster retrieval. |
| Design Position | 64 | Layout grids implemented for primary screens but marketing landing modules still rely on legacy positioning rules. |
| Design Text Grade | 61 | Tone updated for key flows; long-form compliance copy requires review and localisation guidelines. |
| Design Colour Grade | 66 | Token consolidation complete; emo theme contrast testing still outstanding for low-vision scenarios. |
| Design Render Grade | 58 | High-fidelity mocks available for core screens; motion studies pending for dashboards and charts. |
| Compliance Grade | 70 | Initial checklist aligned with regulatory requirements; legal review scheduling pending final copy updates. |
| Security Grade | 63 | Security prompts defined but require integration sign-off with backend threat model owners. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 65 | Interactive prototypes cover 70% of target flows; edge-case states missing for provider exception handling. |
| Design Images Grade | 60 | Imagery curation guidelines drafted; asset optimisation pipeline needs verification for mobile bandwidth constraints. |
| Design Usability Grade | 62 | Early usability test indicates improved navigation; onboarding success rate still below target due to unclear CTAs. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 75 | Identified issues tracked in design QA log; two high-priority accessibility findings outstanding. |
| Test Grade | 55 | Automated visual regression suite not yet wired to new component states; manual checklists drafted. |
| QA Grade | 58 | QA alignment sessions scheduled but coverage matrix incomplete for marketing modules. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 67 | Annotation accuracy improved; Figma-to-code delta analysis pending for provider dashboard. |
| **Overall Grade** | **64** | Solid foundation with clear next steps; critical path items centre on accessibility, motion specs, and validation tooling. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token consolidation, typography, and spacing guidelines are implemented with cross-discipline approval. Accessibility validation continues, with focus on emo theme compliance.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Primary screens updated, but marketing landing pages and edge-case provider flows need further detailing and asset alignment.
3. **Component Catalogue:** New component states documented; interactive prototypes require performance validations, especially for data-heavy widgets.
4. **Validation:** Compliance and QA processes defined but require execution—legal copy review, motion QA, and automated visual regression remain open.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Emo theme variants might fail contrast ratios. → Schedule dedicated low-vision testing sessions and adjust accent tokens accordingly.
- **QA Tooling Gap:** Automated regression tools lagging behind component updates. → Prioritise integration with design token outputs and update Storybook stories for snapshot testing.
- **Cross-team Alignment:** Marketing modules at risk of diverging from core system. → Conduct joint workshop with marketing/brand to reconcile requirements and update shared backlog.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 3 Demo (Week 4)
- **Focus:** Validate theme management workflows, confirm compliance copy approval, and review usability metrics for onboarding.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, Marketing, Compliance, Security, QA.
