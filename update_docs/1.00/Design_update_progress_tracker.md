# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-02-03)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 96 | Telemetry alerting job closes the loop from instrumentation through governance, pairing UI with automated health signals and BI-ready snapshots. |
| Design Organisation | 96 | Alerting dossier, snapshot schema, and runbook updates sit with validation artefacts, giving ops/design/data a single reference stack with escalation paths. |
| Design Position | 90 | Validation coverage extends to admin, auth, marketing, telemetry, and mobile surfaces; remaining microsites scheduled Sprint 4 using shared checklist templates. |
| Design Text Grade | 84 | Compliance tone-of-voice matrix updated for emo marketing variant; alert copy reviewed with legal/comms and timetable locked (Feb 7). |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepared; contrast guardrails reinforced via QA scenarios referencing token JSON. |
| Design Render Grade | 90 | Telemetry console reuses analytics widgets with governed theming; Chromatic capture queued for Theme Studio + telemetry modules. |
| Compliance Grade | 94 | Telemetry payload governance (hashed IPs, schema versioning) now paired with alerting controls and escalation policy signed off with data engineering. |
| Security Grade | 90 | Ingestion API and alerting job validate schema, hash IPs, enforce repeat suppression, and log failures; security sign-off brief scheduled with infosec. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 94 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, and alerting job emit enriched telemetry with tenant/role context, freshness guardrails, and Slack notifications. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails extended to emo marketing variant; CDN validation tasks queued with infra team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 89 | Usability study scripts incorporate announcer behaviour, dashboard discoverability, and alert comprehension checks for admins. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 92 | Deterministic telemetry selectors, auto-refresh hook, and alert state repeat suppression reduce regression noise. |
| Test Grade | 91 | QA scenarios cover ingestion handshake, dashboard validation, and alerting harness verification across staged payloads. |
| QA Grade | 93 | Data engineering + SRE review alerting cadence weekly; dashboard SLAs and Slack routing now part of release-readiness checklist. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 93 | Telemetry schema, alert thresholds, and snapshot payload documented in handoff assets to ensure implementation matches governance requirements. |
| **Overall Grade** | **95** | Instrumentation, dashboard, and alerting pipeline complete; focus shifts to Chromatic/axe automation and tenant segmentation follow-up. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, and alerting job expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; snapshots and runbook guide Looker dashboard setup and alerting response.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, and alerting pipeline live; Looker snapshot handshake and alert channel rehearsal scheduled for 12 Feb analytics review.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery requires legal approval → Legal/marketing review on 7 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, confirm Looker snapshot ingestion + Slack alert rehearsal for pilot tenants, and plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
