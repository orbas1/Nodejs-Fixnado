# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-02-01)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 92 | Validation playbook added `PreferenceChangeAnnouncer`, QA selectors, and screen-level acceptance criteria ensuring parity across code and specs. |
| Design Organisation | 93 | Handoff artefacts centralised in `design_validation_and_handoff.md` with supporting exports under `docs/design/handoff`; tracker alignment complete. |
| Design Position | 88 | Validation coverage extends to admin, auth, and marketing surfaces; remaining microsites scheduled for Sprint 4 adoption using shared checklist templates. |
| Design Text Grade | 82 | Compliance tone-of-voice matrix updated for emo marketing variant; legal review timetable locked (Feb 7). |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepared; contrast guardrails reinforced via QA scenarios referencing token JSON. |
| Design Render Grade | 88 | Chromatic baseline backlog ready post Storybook uplift; marketing previews carry QA selectors for regression capture. |
| Compliance Grade | 92 | Playbook embeds legal checkpoints, GDPR copy validation, and document expiry governance across channels. |
| Security Grade | 82 | Telemetry schema documented with threat-model notes; ingestion verification scheduled alongside data engineering review. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 90 | Theme toggles now emit accessibility announcements and deterministic telemetry enabling automated verification. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails extended to emo marketing variant; CDN validation tasks queued with infra team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 87 | Usability study scripts incorporate new announcer behaviour and personalisation discoverability checkpoints. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 89 | QA selectors reduce flaky automation; aria-live instrumentation mitigates regression gaps for assistive tech. |
| Test Grade | 86 | Playwright + Maestro scenarios defined in `ui-qa-scenarios.csv`; axe-core integration prioritised for Sprint 5. |
| QA Grade | 90 | Validation cadence locked across desk checks, audits, usability, and engineering readout with named owners. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 90 | Cross-referenced checklist items to blueprint IDs and telemetry schema ensuring spec-to-implementation traceability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **91** | Validation, QA, and handoff artefacts delivered; focus shifts to automated visual regression and telemetry monitoring before release gate. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme components augmented with QA instrumentation and aria-live behaviours; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks, with telemetry schema + automation schedule locking QA gate readiness.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** Personalisation events need ingestion verification → Data engineering review (12 Feb) to validate beacon payload ingestion and Looker dashboard wiring.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery requires legal approval → Legal/marketing review on 7 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate execution of accessibility/legal sessions, monitor telemetry ingestion status, and plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
