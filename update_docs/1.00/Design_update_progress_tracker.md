# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-02-02)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 94 | Telemetry ingestion hardens Theme Studio instrumentation end-to-end, pairing aria-live + QA selectors with persisted analytics for governance dashboards. |
| Design Organisation | 94 | Handoff artefacts, telemetry schema, and dashboard runbook now co-located (`design_validation_and_handoff.md`, `fx-theme-preferences.json`, `docs/telemetry/ui-preference-dashboard.md`). |
| Design Position | 88 | Validation coverage extends to admin, auth, and marketing surfaces; remaining microsites scheduled for Sprint 4 adoption using shared checklist templates. |
| Design Text Grade | 82 | Compliance tone-of-voice matrix updated for emo marketing variant; legal review timetable locked (Feb 7). |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts prepared; contrast guardrails reinforced via QA scenarios referencing token JSON. |
| Design Render Grade | 88 | Chromatic baseline backlog ready post Storybook uplift; marketing previews carry QA selectors for regression capture. |
| Compliance Grade | 93 | Telemetry payload governance (hashed IPs, schema versioning) documented and approved with data engineering. |
| Security Grade | 88 | Ingestion API validates schema, hashes IPs, and records correlation IDs for auditability; security sign-off brief scheduled with infosec. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 92 | Theme toggles emit enriched telemetry with tenant/role context, guaranteeing analytics traceability and fallbacks when `sendBeacon` is unavailable. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails extended to emo marketing variant; CDN validation tasks queued with infra team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 87 | Usability study scripts incorporate new announcer behaviour and personalisation discoverability checkpoints. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 90 | Enriched telemetry plus hashed IP governance surfaced in QA scenarios, reducing blind spots in automation diagnostics. |
| Test Grade | 88 | QA scenarios now cover ingestion handshake and analytics summary endpoints, enabling end-to-end verification. |
| QA Grade | 91 | Data engineering added to validation cadence; telemetry dashboards now part of release-readiness checklist. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 92 | Telemetry schema documented in handoff assets and runbook, ensuring implementation matches governance requirements. |
| **Overall Grade** | **93** | Validation artefacts plus telemetry ingestion/dashboards ready; focus shifts to Chromatic/axe automation and microsite adoption. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint exposes daily adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs, and analytics runbook guides Looker dashboard setup.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API + summary endpoint live; monitoring now focused on cross-tenant parity ahead of analytics review (12 Feb).
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery requires legal approval → Legal/marketing review on 7 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate execution of accessibility/legal sessions, confirm telemetry dashboards operational for pilot tenants, and plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
