# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 3 Midpoint — Updated 2025-01-31)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 90 | Theme Studio and personalisation toolkit released with production previews, telemetry, and governance notes; Storybook capture scheduled next sprint. |
| Design Organisation | 91 | Documentation (`theme_personalisation_toolkit.md`) and trackers updated to close DT4; marketing/legal checkpoints embedded in Theme Studio governance module. |
| Design Position | 85 | Theme primitives now live across admin dashboard entry points; remaining microsites will inherit tokens during Sprint 4 rollout. |
| Design Text Grade | 78 | Compliance and campaign copy refreshed within Theme Studio with legal review dates logged for emo campaign collateral. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Light, dark, and emo palettes validated with focus on contrast guardrails; Stark audit queued before GA sign-off. |
| Design Render Grade | 86 | Theme previews, marketing modules, and density states match high-fidelity specs with production gradients and elevation. |
| Compliance Grade | 88 | Telemetry hooks plus validation sprint (Feb 5/7/9) ensure auditability; compliance checklist updated with theme toggles. |
| Security Grade | 78 | Preferences persisted locally with beacon telemetry; awaiting backend threat model update confirming analytics ingestion handling. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 88 | Theme toggles, density/contrast controls, and marketing prototypes validated using real datasets and telemetry instrumentation. |
| Design Images Grade | 82 | Emo imagery and seasonal overlay guidance captured for marketing ops; CDN performance validation aligned with infra team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 84 | Personalisation controls leverage segmented interactions with remote usability test booked for Feb 9 to confirm discoverability. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 86 | Focus states and density overrides validated; telemetry events support ongoing regression monitoring. |
| Test Grade | 82 | Beacon/DataLayer payloads defined for automated validation; Chromatic stories to follow once Storybook coverage lands. |
| QA Grade | 84 | Theme walkthrough recorded for QA handoff; validation sprint actions tracked in Theme Studio governance panel. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 88 | Theme assets cross-referenced with specification IDs and marketing asset manifests for traceability. |
| **Overall Grade** | **88** | Theme & personalisation enablement complete with documentation, telemetry, and validation plan driving toward QA gate. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token system extended with theme gradients, density, and contrast overrides; compatibility exports remain stable across React and Flutter pipelines.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Admin dashboard now surfaces Theme Studio entry point; residual microsites will adopt the shared tokens during Sprint 4 build-out.
3. **Component Catalogue:** New theme-specific components (`ThemePreviewCard`, `MarketingModulePreview`) reuse catalogue primitives; Storybook/Chromatic backlog captures their scenarios for automation.
4. **Validation:** Telemetry, DOM events, and beacon payloads instrumented; validation sprint (Feb 5–9) covers dark/emo accessibility, marketing approvals, and personalisation discoverability.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Stark + manual audits must confirm emo/dark contrast before GA → Validation sprint scheduled with fallback gradients documented in the toolkit.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** Personalisation events need ingestion verification → Data engineering aligned on `kafka.ui-preferences.v1` schema; ingestion tests planned alongside analytics team.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery requires legal approval → Governance checklist in Theme Studio tracks marketing/legal owners and due dates.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 3 Demo (Week 4)
- **Focus:** Review theme adoption telemetry, finalise accessibility audit plan, and lock Storybook/Chromatic delivery timeline for theme + marketing modules.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, Marketing, Compliance, Security, QA.
