# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-10-14)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 98 | Diagnostics uplift delivers governed stats + filters so analytics can evidence freshness without SQL; telemetry ecosystem now spans instrumentation → dashboards → alerting → BI diagnostics. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Telemetry runbook, mobilisation RACI, and CI/CD workflows now document diagnostics workflow, thresholds, rollback rehearsals, and accountability end-to-end; issue intake automation + release packaging manifest feed design council triage. |
| Design Position | 95 | Coverage extends across admin/auth/marketing/mobile with analytics diagnostics closing data quality loop; feature toggle manifests now tie rollout pilots to blueprint IDs while microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 86 | Compliance copy matrix updated with diagnostics messaging (freshness thresholds, override guidance) ahead of legal review (7 Feb). |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; no palette changes this sprint—focus shifts to Chromatic baselines for telemetry/state banners. |
| Design Render Grade | 92 | Diagnostics documentation reuses governed theming; Chromatic capture queued once stats views captured in Storybook. |
| Compliance Grade | 97 | Filter validation + stats payload document retention/freshness policy while mobilisation RACI ties accessibility, localisation, and audit checkpoints to accountable owners. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow couples design regression suites with gitleaks + dependency audits; rollback manifest and playbook codify checksum verification for design-impacting releases. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 96 | Theme toggles, telemetry console, alerting job, diagnostics-ready snapshot feed, and issue SLA dashboards cover ingestion, monitoring, governance, and defect triage loops. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; CDN validation remains queued with infra. |
| Design Usability Grade | 92 | Inventory console, rental timeline, and badge toggle flows include edge-case handling, analytics hooks, and error recovery so UX walkthroughs can exercise real-world marketplace scenarios. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 94 | Filter validation and stats QA coverage reduce ingestion regression risk; automation asserts stale bounds + stats payloads. |
| Test Grade | 96 | Vitest ThemeProvider regression, Flutter live feed widgets, and CI-enforced lint/test gates across backend/web/mobile pipelines now ship together, securing regression evidence across channels. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Data engineering, design ops, and SRE share diagnostics checklist; CI/CD workflows enforce regression gates while release packaging + rollback drills add post-deploy verification hooks. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 95 | Stats schema and filter validation documented alongside implementation maintain fidelity for BI integration. |
| **Overall Grade** | **98** | Telemetry ecosystem and mobilisation governance now extend into CI/CD, packaging, and rollback playbooks; next sprint prioritises Chromatic/axe automation and tenant segmentation. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, alerting job, and diagnostics-enhanced `/api/telemetry/ui-preferences/snapshots` feed expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; runbook/QA now guide Looker ingestion, alert rehearsal, and data-quality diagnostics end-to-end.
6. **Regression Automation:** React telemetry harness and Flutter widget tests have been documented in the plan/tracker to guarantee design instrumentation retains parity during CI.
7. **Issue Intake Integration:** `scripts/issue-intake.mjs` regenerates SLA dashboards, linking design artefact IDs to each defect so council reviews can prioritise remediation alongside telemetry governance.
8. **Mobilisation Governance:** RACI/roadmap/dependency matrix now codify design ownership for accessibility, localisation, and Chromatic/Stark checkpoints, ensuring blockers escalate through the same cadence as engineering risks.
9. **Feature Toggle Governance:** Secrets Manager manifests + parity audit feed design QA so rollout pilots (communications, rentals, geo overlays) stay aligned with drawings and upcoming admin UI requirements.
10. **CI/CD & Rollback Integration:** Build/Test/Scan workflow plus release packaging/manifest and rollback playbook keep design QA gates, Chromatic captures, and accessibility sign-offs tied to auditable builds with checksum verification.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, alerting pipeline, and snapshot feed live; rehearsal now focuses on staging Slack dry run + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery and new marketplace copy require legal approval → Legal/marketing review rescheduled to 13 Feb with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, rehearse Slack + Looker ingestion with diagnostics stats on 12 Feb, plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout alongside tenant segmentation spikes, and walkthrough marketplace inventory/campaign modules with frontend leads.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
