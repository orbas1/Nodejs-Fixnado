# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 3 Kick-off — Updated 2025-01-29)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 82 | Core web blueprints recomposed with shared primitives; remaining work focuses on complex data visualisations and motion specs. |
| Design Organisation | 86 | Blueprint documentation and anchor strategy published; integrate Storybook references for component parity. |
| Design Position | 78 | Home, admin, profile, and marketing layouts follow the 12-column grid; residual marketing microsites queued for Sprint 4. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Compliance copy and localisation status surfaced in-page; legal review on Spanish variants scheduled. |
| Design Colour Grade | 82 | New marketing rails respect tokenised palette; emo palette validation still targeted for Sprint 4. |
| Design Render Grade | 68 | High-fidelity mocks plus production implementations exist; motion studies pending for analytics widgets. |
| Compliance Grade | 80 | Compliance documents, escrow explainers, and automation backlogs embedded; legal sign-off on knowledge base references in progress. |
| Security Grade | 72 | Navigation, dashboards, and profile overlays highlight security prompts; backend threat model alignment remains. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 74 | Blueprint instrumentation covers nav, CTA, and service interactions; edge-case provider flows to be finalised. |
| Design Images Grade | 68 | Marketing modules reference approved imagery sets; optimisation pipeline validation scheduled with performance team. |
| Design Usability Grade | 72 | Persona-led navigation reduces bounce; follow-up usability study booked for Sprint 4 to validate marketing anchors. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 82 | Accessibility audits on recomposed pages passed QA smoke; monitor regression suite as new components roll in. |
| Test Grade | 70 | Blueprint instrumentation wired into analytics dashboards; expand visual regression coverage to new blueprint sections. |
| QA Grade | 74 | Admin and provider blueprints documented for QA handoff; marketing module walkthrough video pending recording. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 78 | Blueprint documentation maps UI modules to specification IDs; provider dashboard delta review underway. |
| **Overall Grade** | **78** | Core blueprints implemented in code with governance overlays; next focus shifts to motion specs and component catalogue expansion. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token consolidation, typography, and spacing guidelines remain stable; emo theme validation still planned for Sprint 4.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Home, admin, provider, and services marketing experiences rebuilt with shared primitives and documented in `core_page_blueprints.md`. Residual microsites and analytics dashboards queued next.
3. **Component Catalogue:** New blueprint components (`PageHeader`, `BlueprintSection`) ready for Storybook integration; data-heavy widget polishing continues.
4. **Validation:** Compliance artefacts embedded within pages; outstanding work covers motion QA, Spanish copy approval, and expanded visual regression.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Emo theme variants might fail contrast ratios. → Primary palette validated via `design_foundations_alignment.md`; dedicated low-vision testing booked alongside Sprint 4 theme validation.
- **QA Tooling Gap:** Automated regression tools lag behind new blueprint components. → Blueprint sections earmarked for Storybook snapshot tests with analytics instrumentation.
- **Cross-team Alignment:** Marketing modules risk diverging from core system. → Services hub now references Contentful/KB IDs; schedule marketing ops workshop to map additional locales.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 3 Demo (Week 4)
- **Focus:** Demonstrate recomposed blueprints, confirm localisation rollout readiness, and agree on motion/Storybook backlog.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, Marketing, Compliance, Security, QA.
