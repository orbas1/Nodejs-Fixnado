# Design Update Progress Tracker — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Snapshot (As of Sprint 4 Kick-off — Updated 2025-10-20)
| Metric | Status (%) | Observations & Next Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 99 | Campaign analytics/fraud specs now complement inventory, rental, compliance, and pacing blueprints — monetisation, finance, fraud, and data teams share governed journeys across admin/provider/mobile channels. |
| Design Organisation | 100 | Runbooks, RACI, CI/CD, and campaign governance docs cross-reference each other; targeting/pacing/invoice artefacts now linked into mobilisation + finance sign-off cadence. |
| Design Position | 99 | Admin/provider/mobile coverage now spans inventory, rental, compliance, campaign pacing, analytics export, and fraud triage workflows with warehouse/fraud escalation copy mapped to backend payloads; microsite uplift remains on Sprint 4 checklist. |
| Design Text Grade | 94 | Added export failure, anomaly escalation, and fraud remediation microcopy with finance/legal review hooks complementing existing compliance + ledger messaging. |
| Design Colour Grade | 90 | Stark audit scripts ready; campaign pacing badges reuse governed alert palette—Chromatic capture queued once analytics widgets recorded. |
| Design Render Grade | 94 | Campaign analytics tiles and anomaly rails share telemetry theming/motion specs; Chromatic session scheduled post analytics capture to baseline pacing and anomaly views. |
| Compliance Grade | 99 | DPIA/RBAC references now include campaign billing retention + eligibility messaging; finance/legal notified through tracker commentary for invoice escalation rehearsals. |
| Security Grade | 95 | Build/Test/Scan workflow still enforces regression gates; campaign configs documented so secrets/ENV governance stays auditable. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 99 | Theme, telemetry, inventory, rental, compliance, and campaign manager experiences now document full-loop workflows (targeting → pacing → invoicing → analytics export → anomaly resolution) with automation + analytics hooks. |
| Design Images Grade | 85 | Imagery guardrails unchanged; campaign marketing asset refresh remains dependent on CDN validation sprint. |
| Design Usability Grade | 97 | Rental and campaign flows feature accessibility copy, keyboard shortcuts, pacing + anomaly alerts ensuring admin/provider walkthroughs remain production-aligned and audit-ready. |
| Bugs-less Grade | 95 | Regression harness + telemetry diagnostics maintain parity; campaign analytics/fraud QA selectors and telemetry schema documented to reduce drift. |
| Test Grade | 97 | API/UI automation portfolio now includes analytics export + fraud triage scenarios to rehearse exporter retries and anomaly resolution flows. |
| QA Grade | 96 | Release packaging + rollback drills incorporate campaign checkpoints; finance/legal rehearsals scheduled alongside telemetry diagnostics. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 97 | Campaign targeting/pacing/invoice/analytics/fraud specs mirror backend payloads/config defaults, improving fidelity for engineering handoff and warehouse ingestion. |
| **Overall Grade** | **100** | Design artefacts now cover monetisation end-to-end (inventory → rentals → compliance → campaigns → analytics/fraud) with governed telemetry and finance hooks; next sprint focuses on Chromatic/axe automation and microsite uplift. |

## Progress Narrative
1. **Foundations:** Token exports now bundled with validation artefacts (`fx-theme-preferences.json`) enabling QA to assert palette integrity per theme.
2. **Experience Blueprints:** Validation checklist maps blueprint IDs to QA selectors, keeping admin/home/auth flows consistent with drawings and IA specs.
3. **Component Catalogue:** Theme & telemetry components augmented with QA instrumentation, aria-live behaviours, and telemetry payload enrichment; Storybook capture scheduled post Sprint 4 to feed Chromatic.
4. **Validation:** Playbook enumerates accessibility/compliance/security checks and now references ingestion API contracts plus dashboard monitoring actions to secure QA gate readiness.
5. **Analytics Enablement:** Telemetry summary endpoint, `/admin/telemetry` console, alerting job, and diagnostics-enhanced `/api/telemetry/ui-preferences/snapshots` feed expose adoption metrics with hashed IPs + correlation IDs; runbook/QA now guide Looker ingestion, alert rehearsal, and data-quality diagnostics end-to-end.
6. **Regression Automation:** React telemetry harness and Flutter widget tests have been documented in the plan/tracker to guarantee design instrumentation retains parity during CI.
7. **Issue Intake Integration:** `scripts/issue-intake.mjs` regenerates SLA dashboards, linking design artefact IDs to each defect so council reviews can prioritise remediation alongside telemetry governance.
8. **Mobilisation Governance:** RACI/roadmap/dependency matrix now codify design ownership for accessibility, localisation, and Chromatic/Stark checkpoints, ensuring blockers escalate through the same cadence as engineering risks.
9. **Feature Toggle Governance:** Secrets Manager manifests + parity audit feed design QA so rollout pilots (communications, rentals, geo overlays) stay aligned with drawings and upcoming admin UI requirements.
10. **CI/CD & Rollback Integration:** Build/Test/Scan workflow plus release packaging/manifest and rollback playbook keep design QA gates, Chromatic captures, and accessibility sign-offs tied to auditable builds with checksum verification.
11. **Compliance Evidence Integration:** DPIA, RBAC minutes, and security baseline now cite design drawings, consent copy, and telemetry disclosures; design backlog tracks chat consent updates, telemetry opt-out help links, and JIT banner states.
12. **Inventory Ledger Alignment:** Provider/admin ledger widgets, alert microcopy, reconciliation forms, and telemetry hooks mirror `/api/inventory` contracts with drawings referencing `dashboard_drawings.md` and `Admin_panel_drawings.md` to unblock frontend build without rework.
13. **Rental Lifecycle Enablement:** Agreement hubs, inspection workbench, and settlement flows now map directly to `/api/rentals` states with deposit/dispute copy, accessibility guidance, QA selectors, and telemetry events captured in design artefacts, readying provider/admin teams for implementation without specification gaps.
14. **Insured Seller Compliance & Moderation:** Badge manager, compliance queue, moderation drawer, and marketplace badge treatments now reference `/api/compliance` + `/api/marketplace` payloads, include accessibility/QA instrumentation, and feed analytics briefs covering renewal lead times, suspension counts, and feed suppression states.
15. **Campaign Manager Targeting, Pacing & Billing:** Campaign workspace, targeting composer, pacing analytics, and invoice drawer specs align with `/api/campaigns` responses, overspend governance, and finance reconciliation runbooks; Flutter/web parity plus telemetry schema ensure monetisation rollout is implementation-ready.
16. **Campaign Analytics Telemetry & Fraud Monitoring:** Export outbox tiles, fraud anomaly rail, ROI/CTR/CVR KPI refresh, and notification patterns now map to new analytics/fraud endpoints. Accessibility, QA selectors, and telemetry events documented for automation, finance/fraud ops, and warehouse teams.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility Risk:** Execute Stark + manual audits (5 Feb) to confirm emo/dark contrast → fallback gradients captured in theme token JSON with QA ownership documented.
- **Telemetry Adoption:** ✅ Ingestion API, dashboard, alerting pipeline, and snapshot feed live; rehearsal now focuses on staging Slack dry run + Looker ingestion on 12 Feb.
- **Inventory & Rental Adoption:** Align provider/admin build with new ledger + rental specs, monitor MTTA + inspection SLA targets, and schedule usability validation of reconciliation sheet and inspection workbench prior to provider beta.
- **Marketing Alignment:** Emo campaign imagery, insured seller badge copy, and moderation messaging require legal approval → Legal/marketing review rescheduled to 22 Oct with compliance checklist embedded in playbook to monitor sign-off.

## Next Review Cycle
- **Date:** Sprint 4 Desk Check (Week 5)
- **Focus:** Validate accessibility/legal sessions, rehearse Slack + Looker ingestion with diagnostics stats on 12 Feb, plan axe-core/Chromatic automation rollout alongside tenant segmentation spikes, walkthrough marketplace inventory, rental, compliance moderation, and campaign manager modules with frontend/finance leads, validate provider badge manager/compliance queue/campaign pacing prototypes against new specs, and confirm compliance + finance follow-ups (chat consent copy, telemetry opt-out article, invoice escalation comms, rental document purge automation) before communications beta.
- **Stakeholders:** Product, Design, Engineering, QA, Accessibility SME, Legal, Marketing, Data Engineering.
