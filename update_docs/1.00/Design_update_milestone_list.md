### Milestone Notes
- Milestones align with engineering sprints to ensure parallel build readiness.
- Cross-functional design council meets twice weekly to unblock dependencies and maintain stakeholder alignment.
- Each milestone triggers documentation updates in the shared repository and a recorded walkthrough for downstream teams.
- Regression automation (React telemetry harness + Flutter live feed widgets) now feeds Milestones M4â€“M8 evidence requirements so design sign-off remains verifiable in CI.
- Issue intake automation feeds SLA dashboards so design council can triage cross-disciplinary defects during milestone reviews without relying on ad-hoc spreadsheets.
- Mobilisation governance pack maps design accountability across all milestones, ensuring accessibility/localisation audits, Chromatic/Stark capture, and blueprint refreshes are reviewed during weekly control boards alongside engineering dependencies.
- Feature toggle governance (Secrets Manager manifests + parity audit) underpins Milestones M4â€“M10 so rollout pilots stay aligned with drawings and forthcoming admin toggle UI.
- CI/CD hardening adds Build/Test/Scan and Release Packaging workflows plus rollback playbook so milestone exits capture auditable artefacts, manifest checksums, and design QA evidence before promotion.
- Compliance evidence pack (DPIA, RBAC minutes, security baseline) now cross-references design artefacts and backlog follow-ups, keeping Milestones M4â€“M10 legally aligned and signalling outstanding consent copy/telemetry help link updates.
- Cache resilience addendum (2025-10-25) records fallback banners, skeleton placements, and concierge messaging for `/providers/:slug`, `/provider/dashboard`, and `/enterprise/panel` so Milestones M11â€“M13 retain sign-off even during API outages.
