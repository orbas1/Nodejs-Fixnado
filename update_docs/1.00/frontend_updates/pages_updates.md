# Explorer Page Updates — Version 1.00

## 2025-10-21 — Explorer Search & Zone Intelligence
- Replaced the static explorer stub with a production-ready experience that synchronises filters to the URL, persists demand-level selections, and hydrates results directly from `/api/search`. Cards now expose provider/company metadata, price formatting, and CTA routing that aligns with Services marketing flows.
- Embedded MapLibre maps with governed styling, sticky positioning, and legend overlay. Zone polygons, match counts, and SLA metrics hydrate from `/api/zones?includeAnalytics=true`, while click interactions drive filter updates and accessibility-safe announcements through the zone insight panel.
- Added reusable explorer components (`components/explorer/ExplorerFilters.jsx`, `ExplorerMap.jsx`, `ExplorerResultList.jsx`, `ZoneInsightPanel.jsx`) and data utilities (`pages/explorerUtils.js`, `api/explorerClient.js`). Vitest coverage ensures demand filtering, zone match indexing, and bounds calculations remain deterministic across SQLite/PostGIS geometry representations.

## 2025-10-22 — Communications Workspace
- Introduced communications workspace (`frontend-reactjs/src/pages/Communications.jsx`) matching admin/provider drawings with conversation rail, message canvas, AI assist summary, notification drawer, and Agora escalation panel.
- Components (`components/communications/ConversationList.jsx`, `MessageComposer.jsx`, `QuietHoursBanner.jsx`, `AgoraLauncher.jsx`) orchestrate thread selection, AI suggestion previews, attachment upload validation, and quiet-hour acknowledgements with keyboard accessibility and telemetry IDs.
- `api/communicationsClient.js` centralises API integration with retry/backoff, AI assist/Agora endpoints, and CSRF token propagation; tests (`components/communications/__tests__/MessageComposer.test.jsx`) verify AI prompt flows, quiet-hour warnings, attachment validation, and message send hotkeys.

## 2025-10-23 — Business Front & Panel Routing
- Added `/providers`, `/providers/:slug`, `/provider/dashboard`, and `/enterprise/panel` routes in `src/App.jsx` so public business fronts and authenticated dashboards resolve directly to the new backend endpoints.
- Reworked `components/Header.jsx` to include a dashboards mega-menu with click-outside handling, Escape support, and mobile accordion behaviour, exposing provider console, enterprise analytics, and curated business fronts as first-class navigation items.
- Extended `panelClient.js` usage across `BusinessFront.jsx`, `ProviderDashboard.jsx`, and `EnterprisePanel.jsx` so slug-driven storefronts, KPI dashboards, and enterprise spend trends reuse token-aware fetchers, skeleton states, and aria-live error messaging.
- Updated QA selectors, breadcrumbs, and action CTAs within panel pages to align with `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`, ensuring provider/enterprise localisation and accessibility sweeps (Task 4.5) have production-ready scaffolding.

## 2025-10-25 — Panel Resilience Remediation
- Replaced `panelClient.js` with a cache-aware implementation that adds abort controllers, memory/sessionStorage TTL caching, token propagation, and schema normalisers so React panels render consistently during transient outages.
- Reauthored `ProviderDashboard.jsx` and `EnterprisePanel.jsx` with end-to-end metric tiles, revenue/incident summaries, compliance watchlists, escalation tracking, and refresh controls that surface cached snapshots alongside actionable banners.
- Rebuilt `BusinessFront.jsx` hero, stats rail, package catalogue, testimonials, compliance badges, portfolio gallery, and concierge contact block so `/providers/:slug` renders production storytelling backed by slug-aware fetch + fallback content.
- Documented regression remediation and new QA selectors across update artefacts to guide Subtask 4.5 accessibility/localisation sweeps and automated dashboard monitoring.

## 2025-10-27 — Localised Panels & Skip Navigation
- Wired `LocaleProvider` into `src/App.jsx` so skip-to-content anchors and route Suspense boundaries respect the current language and direction, ensuring aria-live loaders surface translated messaging during panel hydration.
- Updated `components/Header.jsx` to include bilingual language picker, high-contrast skip-link focus state, and analytics instrumentation for locale toggles aligned with `website_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md` annotations.
- Extended `components/Footer.jsx` and `components/accessibility/SkipToContent.jsx` with translated compliance/support copy plus QA selectors (`data-qa="skip-nav"`, `data-qa="language-picker"`) so accessibility sweeps validate navigation order and voiceover cues.
- Refreshed `ProviderDashboard.jsx`, `EnterprisePanel.jsx`, and `BusinessFront.jsx` copy decks to use translation namespaces with Intl formatting for KPI tiles, alert banners, and concierge storytelling; aria-live toasts announce cache fallbacks in the active locale.

## 2025-10-29 — Persona Role Dashboard
- Rebuilt `src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx` to hydrate admin, provider, serviceman, and enterprise panels from `/api/analytics/dashboards/:persona`, manage timezone-aware query parameters, display skeleton/error states, expose refresh/export controls, and feed navigation/analytics payloads into the redesigned `DashboardLayout`.
- Added CSV export CTA, refresh controls, and offline fallback banner with aria-live messaging to preserve accessibility and observability when APIs degrade; skeleton loaders + empty states align to `dashboard_drawings.md` guidance and reuse analytics colour tokens.
- Updated dashboard components (`components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.jsx`, `DashboardMetricCard.jsx`, `DashboardExportToolbar.jsx`) to support persona-specific labelling, tooltip copy, and QA selectors while tests (`src/pages/__tests__/RoleDashboard.test.jsx`) assert render logic, error handling, and export URL formatting.

## 2025-10-30 — Persona Role Dashboard Verification
- Validated timezone detection fallback, persona guardrails, and retry/onRefresh hooks in `RoleDashboard.jsx` after staging rehearsal; export toolbar now surfaces configured row limits and last-refresh timestamps per design spec.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx†L18-L78】
- Ensured CSV download helper returns filename/blob tuples for download components and raises actionable errors for unsupported personas or server failures, aligning with analytics ops ingestion expectations.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/analyticsDashboardClient.js†L40-L58】
- Recorded QA action to enforce CI reporters in `npm test` to suppress Vitest spinner noise observed during `CI=1` verification and maintain readable console evidence for dashboard regressions.【152a08†L1-L10】

## 2025-10-31 — Persona Dashboard Feature Toggle Experience
- Added feature toggle context and client (`src/providers/FeatureToggleProvider.jsx`, `src/api/featureToggleClient.js`) so persona dashboards consume Secrets Manager manifests, cache cohort assignments, and expose refresh hooks without reloading the page. `src/main.jsx` now wraps the React tree with the provider.
- Introduced `DashboardAccessGate.jsx` to block analytics explores when `analytics-dashboards` is disabled or in pilot, surfacing toggle owner/ticket metadata, rollout percentages, and support CTA copy matching `Dashboard Designs.md`. `DashboardLayout.jsx` renders a toggle summary card alongside persona headings.
- Updated `RoleDashboard.jsx` to respect toggle evaluation before fetching analytics data, surface the access gate, and hydrate toggle metadata for telemetry/export instrumentation. Vitest suite (`src/pages/__tests__/RoleDashboard.test.jsx`) now covers both enabled and gated scenarios.
