# Explorer Page Updates — Version 1.00

## 2025-10-21 — Explorer Search & Zone Intelligence
- Replaced the static explorer stub with a production-ready experience that synchronises filters to the URL, persists demand-level selections, and hydrates results directly from `/api/search`. Cards now expose provider/company metadata, price formatting, and CTA routing that aligns with Services marketing flows.
- Embedded MapLibre maps with governed styling, sticky positioning, and legend overlay. Zone polygons, match counts, and SLA metrics hydrate from `/api/zones?includeAnalytics=true`, while click interactions drive filter updates and accessibility-safe announcements through the zone insight panel.
- Added reusable explorer components (`components/explorer/ExplorerFilters.jsx`, `ExplorerMap.jsx`, `ExplorerResultList.jsx`, `ZoneInsightPanel.jsx`) and data utilities (`pages/explorerUtils.js`, `api/explorerClient.js`). Vitest coverage ensures demand filtering, zone match indexing, and bounds calculations remain deterministic across SQLite/PostGIS geometry representations.

## 2025-10-22 — Communications Workspace
- Introduced communications workspace (`frontend-reactjs/src/pages/Communications.jsx`) matching admin/provider drawings with conversation rail, message canvas, AI assist summary, notification drawer, and Agora escalation panel.
- Components (`components/communications/ConversationList.jsx`, `MessageComposer.jsx`, `QuietHoursBanner.jsx`, `AgoraLauncher.jsx`) orchestrate thread selection, AI suggestion previews, attachment upload validation, and quiet-hour acknowledgements with keyboard accessibility and telemetry IDs.
- `api/communicationsClient.js` centralises API integration with retry/backoff, AI assist/Agora endpoints, and CSRF token propagation; tests (`components/communications/__tests__/MessageComposer.test.jsx`) verify AI prompt flows, quiet-hour warnings, attachment validation, and message send hotkeys.

## 2025-10-23 — Business Front & Panel Routing
- Added `/providers`, `/providers/:slug`, `/provider/dashboard`, and `/enterprise/panel` routes in `src/App.jsx` so public business fronts and authenticated dashboards resolve directly to the new backend endpoints.
- Reworked `components/Header.jsx` to include a dashboards mega-menu with click-outside handling, Escape support, and mobile accordion behaviour, exposing provider console, enterprise analytics, and curated business fronts as first-class navigation items.
- Extended `panelClient.js` usage across `BusinessFront.jsx`, `ProviderDashboard.jsx`, and `EnterprisePanel.jsx` so slug-driven storefronts, KPI dashboards, and enterprise spend trends reuse token-aware fetchers, skeleton states, and aria-live error messaging.
- Updated QA selectors, breadcrumbs, and action CTAs within panel pages to align with `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`, ensuring provider/enterprise localisation and accessibility sweeps (Task 4.5) have production-ready scaffolding.
