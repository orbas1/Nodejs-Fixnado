## 2025-10-24 â€” Analytics Event Catalogue Rollout
- Established `analyticsEventService` catalogue with governed event names covering zones (`zone.created`, `zone.updated`, `zone.deleted`), bookings (`booking.created`, `booking.status_transition`, `booking.assignment.created`, `booking.dispute.raised`), rentals (`rental.requested`, `rental.status_transition`, `rental.inspection.completed`), ads (`ads.campaign.metrics_recorded`, `ads.campaign.fraud_signal`), and communications (`communications.message.sent`, `communications.delivery.suppressed`).
- Each definition specifies domain, entity type, required metadata keys, and tenant resolution hints so emitting services automatically infer tenancy and enforce payload completeness before persistence.
- Metadata validation rejects missing/undefined keys, sanitises undefined values, and normalises timestamps; actor context supports string shorthand or structured `{ type, id, label }` input with fallbacks for system emitters.
- Zone, booking, rental, campaign, and communications services now call `recordAnalyticsEvent(s)` during lifecycle transitions, passing correlation IDs, channel/source hints, and domain-specific metadata (e.g., booking SLA expiry, rental inspection charges, campaign metric tallies, communications quiet-hour reasons) aligned with dashboards and warehouse models.
- Event catalogue exposed via `analyticsEventCatalog` + `getAnalyticsEventDefinition` so downstream tooling (ETL/backfills, QA harnesses) can programmatically inspect required metadata when introducing new emitters.
