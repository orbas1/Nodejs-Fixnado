## 2025-10-22 â€” Communications Screens
- Documented mobile communications hub drawing alignment: conversation list mirrors `App_screens_drawings.md` with unread badges, AI assist indicators, and quiet-hour alerts. Screen spec references new Riverpod controller outputs and backend payload keys.
- Added video escalation sheet UX capturing Agora session countdown, microphone/camera toggles, compliance consent copy, and fallback dial-in instructions, ensuring parity with web Agora launcher.
- Updated notification centre overlay design notes to include conversation pinning, urgent flag display, and offline resend banners consistent with new backend delivery statuses.
