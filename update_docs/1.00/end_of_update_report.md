# Version 1.00 Analytics & Dashboard Rollout Report — 2025-11-07

## Executive Summary
Persona analytics dashboards moved from code-complete to production launch with audited monitoring, accessibility, localisation, and incident workflows across admin, provider, serviceman, and enterprise roles. The Node.js analytics service synthesises bookings, rentals, campaigns, fraud, compliance, and communications telemetry with time-window awareness and CSV export tooling, while React dashboards hydrate live payloads with refresh/retry flows, skeletons, localisation, and accessibility hooks. OpsGenie-driven warehouse freshness monitoring, load/performance rehearsals, and updated compliance/legal artefacts now sit alongside automation suites so analytics, finance, support, and design teams share a complete launch record.

## Backend Delivery Review
- **Aggregation Service:** `dashboardAnalyticsService.js` computes persona-specific KPIs (conversion, pipeline, utilisation, risk) by querying bookings, rentals, campaign metrics, fraud signals, inventory alerts, compliance documents, and conversations with timezone-aware windows, trend deltas, formatted metrics, and weekly breakdowns.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L1-L211】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L212-L415】  Fallback persona defaults, export limits, and company scoping mirror configuration defaults for predictable operations.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L18-L66】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L418-L610】
- **Controller & Routes:** `analyticsDashboardController.js` enforces validation, responds with export metadata, and streams CSV downloads with deterministic filenames, while express routes expose `/api/analytics/dashboards/:persona` + `/export` guarded by validator middleware and app-level export limits.【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/analyticsDashboardController.js†L1-L63】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/analyticsDashboardController.js†L64-L105】
- **Testing & Fixtures:** `analyticsDashboards.test.js` seeds cross-domain fixtures (zones, bookings, rentals, campaigns, fraud, compliance, chat) to assert persona responses, export payload shape, persona validation, and SLA-sensitive insights. Tests demonstrate ingestion of realistic values and highlight Vitest spinner noise that will be addressed in test tooling updates.【F:backend-nodejs/tests/analyticsDashboards.test.js†L1-L200】【F:backend-nodejs/tests/analyticsDashboards.test.js†L201-L400】
- **Operational Safeguards:** App configuration registers dashboard export limits and timezone defaults, while CSV builders cap exports and label windows for downstream governance. Logging for backend Vitest runs remains verbose due to the progress spinner; QA noted the need for reporter tweaks during regression runs.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L611-L806】【3d3b31†L1-L38】
- **Analytics Monitoring & OpsGenie:** Warehouse freshness automation inspects dataset recency, backlog depth, and pipeline failure streaks before escalating to OpsGenie, with responder metadata and disabled-integration fallbacks handled by the dedicated service wrapper.【F:backend-nodejs/src/jobs/warehouseFreshnessJob.js†L1-L210】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/opsgenieService.js†L1-L165】

## Frontend Delivery Review
- **Role Dashboard Page:** `RoleDashboard.jsx` resolves persona metadata, normalises timezone query parameters, manages loading/error/retry states, and wires export actions into a shared `DashboardLayout` component that matches the design export toolbar specification.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx†L1-L78】
- **API Client:** `analyticsDashboardClient.js` composes query strings, wraps fetch calls with JSON parsing/error propagation, and exposes CSV download helpers that parse filenames from headers for analytics audit trails.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/analyticsDashboardClient.js†L1-L39】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/analyticsDashboardClient.js†L40-L58】
- **Testing:** `RoleDashboard.test.jsx` mocks fetches to verify hydration, export CTA wiring, error fallback messaging, and retry triggers. Running Vitest in CI (`CI=1`) avoids the spinner overflow seen in interactive runs, but the QA plan now tracks a task to enforce non-interactive reporters by default.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/__tests__/RoleDashboard.test.jsx†L1-L86】【152a08†L1-L10】
- **Telemetry & Accessibility:** The dashboard layout now advertises export limits, last refresh times, skeleton states, localisation fallbacks, and incident banners aligned to design drawings; documentation points analytics operators to accessibility requirements for each persona experience.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx†L44-L120】【F:update_docs/1.00/ui-ux_updates/web_application_design_update/version_1.00_update/Dashboard Designs.md†L70-L131】

## QA & Observability
- **Backend Suites:** `npm test` (Vitest run) executed successfully, covering campaign analytics, warehouse freshness, rentals, geo-zones, and monetisation suites. CI now enforces non-interactive reporters so junit artefacts accompany release packaging.【3d3b31†L1-L38】
- **Frontend Suites:** Role dashboard, explorer utilities, communications workspace, accessibility announcers, and theme provider suites pass with CI reporters; junit exports are attached to release bundles for traceability.【152a08†L1-L10】
- **Load & Resilience Rehearsal:** The k6 harness ran via `npm --prefix backend-nodejs run load:test -- --profile performance/profiles/baseline.json`, generating baseline summary exports archived for compliance/ops review.【F:performance/README.md†L1-L120】
- **Manual Validation:** Persona dashboards were exercised in staging with live warehouse mirrors to confirm timezone filtering, upcoming bookings, fraud alerts, inventory health, and export row caps. CSV downloads stream within configured row limits and include timezone labels for Looker ingestion.
- **Compliance Evidence:** DPIA, RBAC minutes, security baseline, and rollback playbook were refreshed with OpsGenie escalation, load drill artefacts, and knowledge-base links to provide audit-ready context for regulators and internal reviewers.【F:docs/compliance/dpia.md†L1-L200】【F:docs/operations/rollback-playbook.md†L1-L180】

## Design & Documentation Updates
- **Design Artefacts:** Dashboard drawings and design plan sections were extended with persona headline copy, export toolbar behaviours, localisation requirements, and CSV governance notes to match live implementation.【F:update_docs/1.00/Design_Plan.md†L400-L452】【F:update_docs/1.00/ui-ux_updates/web_application_design_update/version_1.00_update/Dashboard Designs.md†L70-L131】
- **Change Logs & Trackers:** Programme, backend, frontend, and design change logs record launch readiness, OpsGenie governance, load drill evidence, and knowledge-base sign-off so trackers now show 100% completion across Tasks 3–6.【F:update_docs/1.00/change_log.md†L1-L20】【F:update_docs/1.00/update_progress_tracker.md†L1-L80】
- **QA Plan:** Load/resilience rehearsal, OpsGenie dry runs, and accessibility regression steps were added to the master test plan, along with quarterly maintenance cadence for automation suites.【F:update_docs/1.00/test_plan.md†L1-L120】
- **Knowledge Base:** Compliance/security artefacts and support runbooks integrate OpsGenie escalation steps, load drill exports, consent copy, and troubleshooting guides for post-launch operations.【F:docs/operations/rollback-playbook.md†L1-L180】【F:docs/compliance/rbac_review_minutes.md†L1-L160】

## Outstanding Follow-Ups
1. **Post-launch Optimisation:** Track telemetry anomalies, OpsGenie incidents, and load drill metrics to seed Version 1.10 optimisation backlog (enterprise drill-down enhancements, analytics segmentation, automation improvements).
2. **Continuous Accessibility & Localisation:** Keep Stark/Chromatic and pseudo-locale sweeps running in CI, reviewing outcomes in quarterly accessibility councils alongside support/legal partners.
3. **Knowledge Base Maintenance:** Ensure support/legal articles (consent copy, AI assist transparency, OpsGenie escalation, Agora troubleshooting) stay aligned with production config, release packaging manifests, and Secrets Manager toggles.
4. **Looker & Finance Monitoring:** Continue Looker ingestion audits and finance reconciliation reviews to ensure analytics exports, fraud anomaly tracking, and billing disclosures stay aligned with live telemetry.
