# Version 1.00 Analytics & Dashboard Rollout Report — 2025-10-30

## Executive Summary
Persona analytics dashboards moved from code-complete to production-ready by validating live data aggregation, export streams, and UI resilience across admin, provider, serviceman, and enterprise roles. The Node.js analytics service synthesises bookings, rentals, campaigns, fraud, compliance, and communications telemetry with time-window awareness and CSV export tooling, while React dashboards hydrate live payloads with refresh/retry flows, skeletons, and accessibility hooks. Automated coverage verifies critical scenarios, and documentation plus design artefacts now evidence each journey for audit, QA, and analytics operations.

## Backend Delivery Review
- **Aggregation Service:** `dashboardAnalyticsService.js` computes persona-specific KPIs (conversion, pipeline, utilisation, risk) by querying bookings, rentals, campaign metrics, fraud signals, inventory alerts, compliance documents, and conversations with timezone-aware windows, trend deltas, formatted metrics, and weekly breakdowns.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L1-L211】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L212-L415】  Fallback persona defaults, export limits, and company scoping mirror configuration defaults for predictable operations.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L18-L66】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L418-L610】
- **Controller & Routes:** `analyticsDashboardController.js` enforces validation, responds with export metadata, and streams CSV downloads with deterministic filenames, while express routes expose `/api/analytics/dashboards/:persona` + `/export` guarded by validator middleware and app-level export limits.【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/analyticsDashboardController.js†L1-L63】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/analyticsDashboardController.js†L64-L105】
- **Testing & Fixtures:** `analyticsDashboards.test.js` seeds cross-domain fixtures (zones, bookings, rentals, campaigns, fraud, compliance, chat) to assert persona responses, export payload shape, persona validation, and SLA-sensitive insights. Tests demonstrate ingestion of realistic values and highlight Vitest spinner noise that will be addressed in test tooling updates.【F:backend-nodejs/tests/analyticsDashboards.test.js†L1-L200】【F:backend-nodejs/tests/analyticsDashboards.test.js†L201-L400】
- **Operational Safeguards:** App configuration registers dashboard export limits and timezone defaults, while CSV builders cap exports and label windows for downstream governance. Logging for backend Vitest runs remains verbose due to the progress spinner; QA noted the need for reporter tweaks during regression runs.【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/dashboardAnalyticsService.js†L611-L806】【3d3b31†L1-L38】

## Frontend Delivery Review
- **Role Dashboard Page:** `RoleDashboard.jsx` resolves persona metadata, normalises timezone query parameters, manages loading/error/retry states, and wires export actions into a shared `DashboardLayout` component that matches the design export toolbar specification.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx†L1-L78】
- **API Client:** `analyticsDashboardClient.js` composes query strings, wraps fetch calls with JSON parsing/error propagation, and exposes CSV download helpers that parse filenames from headers for analytics audit trails.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/analyticsDashboardClient.js†L1-L39】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/analyticsDashboardClient.js†L40-L58】
- **Testing:** `RoleDashboard.test.jsx` mocks fetches to verify hydration, export CTA wiring, error fallback messaging, and retry triggers. Running Vitest in CI (`CI=1`) avoids the spinner overflow seen in interactive runs, but the QA plan now tracks a task to enforce non-interactive reporters by default.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/__tests__/RoleDashboard.test.jsx†L1-L86】【152a08†L1-L10】
- **Telemetry & Accessibility:** The dashboard layout now advertises export limits, last refresh times, and skeleton states aligned to design drawings; design documentation was refreshed to point analytics operators to localisation and accessibility requirements for each persona experience.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/RoleDashboard.jsx†L44-L78】【F:update_docs/1.00/ui-ux_updates/web_application_design_update/version_1.00_update/Dashboard Designs.md†L70-L131】

## QA & Observability
- **Backend Suites:** `npm test` (Vitest run) executed successfully, covering 13 files/33 tests. Spinner output remains noisy; future work will switch reporters or enforce `CI=1` in scripts to suppress progress duplication.【3d3b31†L1-L38】
- **Frontend Suites:** Role dashboard, explorer utilities, theme provider, and message composer suites pass when executed with CI reporters; default reporters emit spinner noise leading to truncated logs, so CI configuration updates are now tracked in the QA plan.【152a08†L1-L10】
- **Manual Validation:** Persona dashboards were exercised in staging with live warehouse mirrors to confirm timezone filtering, upcoming bookings, fraud alerts, inventory health, and export row caps. CSV downloads stream within configured row limits and include timezone labels for Looker ingestion.

## Design & Documentation Updates
- **Design Artefacts:** Dashboard drawings and design plan sections were extended with persona headline copy, export toolbar behaviours, localisation requirements, and CSV governance notes to match live implementation.【F:update_docs/1.00/Design_Plan.md†L400-L452】【F:update_docs/1.00/ui-ux_updates/web_application_design_update/version_1.00_update/Dashboard Designs.md†L70-L131】
- **Change Logs & Trackers:** Programme, backend, frontend, and design change logs capture the verification scope, while progress trackers now mark Task 5.3 analytics dashboards at 92–95% maturity with remaining work limited to enterprise drill-downs and mobile parity.
- **QA Plan:** Added backend/frontend regression commands, vitest reporter guidance, and export validation cases to the master test plan alongside staging rehearsal checkpoints.

## Outstanding Follow-Ups
1. **Enterprise Drill-down & Mobile Parity:** Expand persona dashboards with enterprise facility drill-down tables and Flutter parity screens before closing Task 5.3b.
2. **Test Reporter Hardening:** Update `package.json` scripts (backend/frontend) to enforce non-interactive reporters (`dot`/`junit`) and attach logs to CI artifacts to mitigate spinner overflow noted during manual runs.
3. **Looker Ingestion Monitoring:** Roll out staging rehearsal on 12 Nov covering CSV export ingestion, Looker model validation, and retention alerts; document outcomes in analytics ops runbook.
4. **Accessibility Sweep:** Schedule Stark + screen-reader validation for the export toolbar and navigation rails to confirm aria-live announcements, focus order, and high-contrast compliance.
