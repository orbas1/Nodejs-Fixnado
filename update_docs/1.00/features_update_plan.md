# Version 1.00 – Features Update Plan

## 1. Planning & Governance
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Conduct kick-off with product, engineering, compliance, marketing, and customer ops to review feature scope and success metrics.
- **Roadmap Definition**: Break the program into themed epics (Geo-Zonal, Service Acquisition, Marketplace & Inventory, Compliance & Trust, Communications, Monetisation, Analytics).
- **Resourcing**: Assign squad leads (Backend, Frontend Web, Flutter Apps, Infrastructure, QA, Data) with capacity plans and contingency buffers.
- **Requirements Traceability**: Capture detailed user stories and acceptance criteria in the project tracker. Link every story to regulatory requirements (GDPR, UK compliance) where applicable.
- **Risk Register**: Maintain a living register with severity, mitigation owners, and review cadence.

## 2. Architecture & Technical Design
- **System Blueprint**: Update architecture diagrams to include new microservices or modules for zones, bookings, inventory, ads, and compliance vaults.
- **Data Modeling**: Finalise schema changes for zones (polygons), bookings (multi-serviceman assignments), marketplace products, inventory transactions, documents, and ad campaigns.
- **Integration Contracts**: Define API contracts for Agora, AI chat integrations (OpenAI/Claude), payment gateways (multi-currency), and ad reporting interfaces.
- **Security & Compliance Design**: Extend role-based access control (RBAC) for new panels, implement audit logging strategies, and define data retention policies.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Forecast load for chat, video calls, and explorer search. Plan caching, indexing, and asynchronous processing as needed.

## 3. Backend Implementation
- **Geo-Zone Service**: Build APIs for polygon zone CRUD, zone assignment to services, and zone-based provider matching logic.
- **Booking Orchestrator**: Implement flows for on-demand vs scheduled bookings, multi-serviceman coordination, custom job lifecycle (creation → bidding → acceptance → completion) including comments and queries.
- **Marketplace & Inventory**: Create services for tool rental/sales listings, availability tracking, inventory audits, and insured-seller validation.
- **Compliance & Identity**: Develop document submission, verification workflows (insurance, DBS, ID), expiry notifications, and UK compliance reporting endpoints.
- **Financial Layer**: Implement commission structures, multi-tax/multi-currency calculations, and revenue sharing reports.
- **Communication Services**: Integrate AI chat providers with rate limiting, transcript logging, and fallback. Add Agora session orchestration for video/phone calls.
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Extend event tracking, aggregate booking funnels, ad performance, inventory turnover metrics, and export capabilities for the admin panel.

## 4. Frontend Web (React) Delivery
- **Explorer & Search**: Build global explorer page with filters (zones, categories, packages, rentals). Visualise zone coverage on maps.
- **Marketplace UI**: Implement rental/sales catalogue, inventory status indicators, and insured seller badges.
- **Booking Flows**: Deliver guided booking funnel for on-demand and scheduled services, including custom job creation, bid management, and acceptance screens.
- **Profile & Business Fronts**: Craft dynamic layouts for servicemen profiles and provider business fronts (banner, video, galleries, reviews, social links).
- **Panels & Dashboards**: Expand admin, servicemen, provider, and enterprise panels with relevant modules (compliance queue, commission settings, analytics, Finova ad manager).
- **Chat & Calls**: Embed chat widgets with AI assist toggles and launch Agora sessions for video/voice calls.
- **Security UX**: Implement MFA prompts, consent modals for GDPR, and secure document upload flows.

## 5. Flutter Apps Delivery
- **App Alignment**: Ensure parity of new features across Servicemen, User, Provider, and Enterprise apps.
- **Geo & Booking Features**: Integrate map-based zone discovery, booking creation, job bidding, and availability management.
- **Marketplace & Inventory**: Enable tool rental requests, stock visibility, and in-app checkout/hand-off processes.
- **Communication Features**: Add chat with AI assist, Agora video/voice modules, and notification routing.
- **Panels & Dashboards**: Provide mobile-friendly panels with role-specific modules (job queue, compliance alerts, commission summaries).
- **Internationalisation**: Implement multi-language strings, currency selectors, and regional tax display.

## 6. Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Environment Setup**: Provision staging environments mirroring production integrations (Agora, AI providers, payment processors).
- **API Key Management**: Securely store provider-specific AI keys using vault services with rotation policies.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Update pipelines to include new test suites (API, mobile, frontend) and compliance checks.
- **Observability**: Enhance logging, distributed tracing, and alerting for new services (zones, marketplace, ads, communications).
- **Data Protection**: Implement encryption at rest for document storage, data anonymisation for analytics, and GDPR-compliant data lifecycle management.
- **Scalability Planning**: Configure auto-scaling policies for chat, calling, and explorer search workloads.

## 7. Quality Assurance & Testing
- **Test Strategy**: Define unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security test plans per feature group.
- **Automation**: Expand automated regression suites for booking flows, marketplace transactions, compliance submissions, and ad campaign management.
- **Load & Resilience**: Conduct load testing for real-time communications and explorer search; perform chaos drills on critical services.
- **Compliance Validation**: Run GDPR and UK compliance audits, including data subject request rehearsal and HMRC reporting simulations.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Coordinate with pilot providers and internal teams to validate custom job workflows, AI chat behaviour, and zone accuracy.

## 8. Documentation & Training
- **Knowledge Base**: Update internal and external documentation covering new features, APIs, and SOPs.
- **Training Sessions**: Run workshops for support, operations, and compliance teams on new panels and workflows.
- **Release Notes**: Prepare customer-facing changelog and internal deployment checklist.
- **Support Playbooks**: Draft troubleshooting guides for Agora calls, AI chat integration, marketplace disputes, and compliance escalations.

## 9. Launch & Post-Launch
- **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to beta cohorts, monitor KPIs, and expand gradually.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Track analytics dashboards, collect NPS/CSAT, and open feedback loops via in-app prompts.
- **Hypercare**: Establish a 2-week hypercare period with on-call rotations for critical squads.
- **Iterative Improvements**: Log post-launch enhancement backlog, focusing on automation, predictive insights, and partner integrations.
