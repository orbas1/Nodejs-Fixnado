# Design Update Task List — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Task 1 — Consolidate Design Foundations
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Inventory existing colour, typography, and spacing tokens across application and web artefacts.
  2. Define unified naming conventions and map deprecated tokens to new standards.
  3. Produce accessibility contrast validation matrix for primary/background combinations.
  4. Export token libraries to shared repositories (JSON, SCSS, native formats).
  5. Host cross-discipline review to confirm adoption timeline and governance.

## Task 2 — Recompose Core Page Blueprints
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Update home, dashboard, and profile wireframes with new grid rules and responsive breakpoints.
  2. Integrate revised navigation hierarchy and breadcrumb strategy into annotated flows.
  3. Overlay security checkpoints and compliance messaging in sensitive workflows.
  4. Validate copy and localisation requirements with content strategy team.
  5. Publish blueprint walkthrough videos and slide decks for engineering teams.

## Task 3 — Expand Component & Widget Catalogue
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Audit existing button, card, form, and widget variants to identify redundancies.
  2. Define canonical states (default, hover, focus, pressed, disabled, destructive) and document in component specs.
  3. Align data visualisation modules with refreshed dashboard styling and motion guidelines.
  4. Provide code-ready assets (SVGs, Lottie files) and state diagrams to engineering.
  5. Establish regression checklist linking components to design tokens and testing criteria.

## Task 4 — Theme & Personalisation Enablement
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Design theme management screen with preview cards for standard, dark, and emo palettes.
  2. Document emo theme-specific imagery, gradients, and typography nuances with accessibility guardrails.

  4. Collaborate with backend to confirm personalisation data hooks and analytics events.
  5. Run user validation sessions focused on theme discoverability and comprehension.

## Task 5 — Validation, QA, and Handoff
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Compile accessibility, compliance, and security checklists per screen with acceptance criteria.
  2. Coordinate design QA reviews aligned with engineering sprint demos and update trackers.
  3. Produce implementation handoff package (Figma links, redlines, token exports, documentation index).
  4. Support development during integration, resolving gaps and clarifying edge cases.
  5. Capture lessons learned and backlog items for post-launch iterations.
