# Design Update Task List — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Task 1 — Consolidate Design Foundations *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-28)*
- **Delivery Owner:** Lead Product Designer (Design Systems) with Frontend & Flutter Tech Leads.
- **Evidence:** See `ui-ux_updates/design_foundations_alignment.md`, updated contrast artefacts in `Screens_Update.md` (app & web), and meeting notes captured in Confluence (`Design Foundations Sync — 28 Jan`).
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Inventory existing colour, typography, and spacing tokens across application and web artefacts — compiled canonical tables covering 38 colour tokens, 11 type styles, and 8 spacing levels.
  2. ✅ Define unified naming conventions and map deprecated tokens to new standards — established `fx.{category}.{sub-system}.{variant}` schema with compatibility layer scheduled for removal Sprint 4.
  3. ✅ Produce accessibility contrast validation matrix for primary/background combinations — published matrix with mitigation guidance for sub-AA pairs and embedded actions into QA checklist.
  4. ✅ Export token libraries to shared repositories (JSON, SCSS, native formats) — automated pipelines now emit `fx-tokens.v1.00` packages for React, Flutter, and Figma nightly syncs.
  5. ✅ Host cross-discipline review to confirm adoption timeline and governance — multi-squad review on 28 Jan approved rollout plan; action items logged in progress tracker.

## Task 2 — Recompose Core Page Blueprints *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-29)*
- **Delivery Owner:** UX Architect with Product Manager + Frontend Tech Lead.
- **Evidence:** Updated React implementations (`Home.jsx`, `AdminDashboard.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, `Services.jsx`), blueprint documentation (`ui-ux_updates/core_page_blueprints.md`), and navigation anchors in `Header.jsx`.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Update home, dashboard, and profile wireframes with new grid rules and responsive breakpoints — implemented via shared `BlueprintSection` layout and page-level recomposition.
  2. ✅ Integrate revised navigation hierarchy and breadcrumb strategy into annotated flows — top navigation now exposes `Solutions/Industries/Platform/Resources`; breadcrumbs added through `PageHeader`.
  3. ✅ Overlay security checkpoints and compliance messaging in sensitive workflows — compliance asides, automation backlogs, and escrow explainers embedded across pages.
  4. ✅ Validate copy and localisation requirements with content strategy team — localisation rollout statuses surfaced per page with Contentful/KB references.
  5. ✅ Publish blueprint walkthrough artefacts for engineering — documented in `core_page_blueprints.md` with next actions and instrumentation guidance.

## Task 3 — Expand Component & Widget Catalogue
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Audit existing button, card, form, and widget variants to identify redundancies.
  2. Define canonical states (default, hover, focus, pressed, disabled, destructive) and document in component specs.
  3. Align data visualisation modules with refreshed dashboard styling and motion guidelines.
  4. Provide code-ready assets (SVGs, Lottie files) and state diagrams to engineering.
  5. Establish regression checklist linking components to design tokens and testing criteria.

## Task 4 — Theme & Personalisation Enablement
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Design theme management screen with preview cards for standard, dark, and emo palettes.
  2. Document emo theme-specific imagery, gradients, and typography nuances with accessibility guardrails.
  3. Prototype marketing module variations for hero band, announcement panel, and seasonal overlays.
  4. Collaborate with backend to confirm personalisation data hooks and analytics events.
  5. Run user validation sessions focused on theme discoverability and comprehension.

## Task 5 — Validation, QA, and Handoff
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Compile accessibility, compliance, and security checklists per screen with acceptance criteria.
  2. Coordinate design QA reviews aligned with engineering sprint demos and update trackers.
  3. Produce implementation handoff package (Figma links, redlines, token exports, documentation index).
  4. Support development during integration, resolving gaps and clarifying edge cases.
  5. Capture lessons learned and backlog items for post-launch iterations.
