# Design Update Task List — Version 1.00 UI/UX

## Task 1 — Consolidate Design Foundations *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-28)*
- **Delivery Owner:** Lead Product Designer (Design Systems) with Frontend & Flutter Tech Leads.
- **Evidence:** See `ui-ux_updates/design_foundations_alignment.md`, updated contrast artefacts in `Screens_Update.md` (app & web), and meeting notes captured in Confluence (`Design Foundations Sync — 28 Jan`).
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Inventory existing colour, typography, and spacing tokens across application and web artefacts — compiled canonical tables covering 38 colour tokens, 11 type styles, and 8 spacing levels.
  2. ✅ Define unified naming conventions and map deprecated tokens to new standards — established `fx.{category}.{sub-system}.{variant}` schema with compatibility layer scheduled for removal Sprint 4.
  3. ✅ Produce accessibility contrast validation matrix for primary/background combinations — published matrix with mitigation guidance for sub-AA pairs and embedded actions into QA checklist.
  4. ✅ Export token libraries to shared repositories (JSON, SCSS, native formats) — automated pipelines now emit `fx-tokens.v1.00` packages for React, Flutter, and Figma nightly syncs.
  5. ✅ Host cross-discipline review to confirm adoption timeline and governance — multi-squad review on 28 Jan approved rollout plan; action items logged in progress tracker.

## Task 2 — Recompose Core Page Blueprints *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-29)*
- **Delivery Owner:** UX Architect with Product Manager + Frontend Tech Lead.
- **Evidence:** Updated React implementations (`Home.jsx`, `AdminDashboard.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, `Services.jsx`), blueprint documentation (`ui-ux_updates/core_page_blueprints.md`), and navigation anchors in `Header.jsx`.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Update home, dashboard, and profile wireframes with new grid rules and responsive breakpoints — implemented via shared `BlueprintSection` layout and page-level recomposition.
  2. ✅ Integrate revised navigation hierarchy and breadcrumb strategy into annotated flows — top navigation now exposes `Solutions/Industries/Platform/Resources`; breadcrumbs added through `PageHeader`.
  3. ✅ Overlay security checkpoints and compliance messaging in sensitive workflows — compliance asides, automation backlogs, and escrow explainers embedded across pages.
  4. ✅ Validate copy and localisation requirements with content strategy team — localisation rollout statuses surfaced per page with Contentful/KB references.
  5. ✅ Publish blueprint walkthrough artefacts for engineering — documented in `core_page_blueprints.md` with next actions and instrumentation guidance.

## Task 3 — Expand Component & Widget Catalogue *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-30)*
- **Evidence:** `ui-ux_updates/component_catalogue_expansion.md`, updated React implementations under `frontend-reactjs/src/components/ui` and `frontend-reactjs/src/components/widgets`, and Admin dashboard integration in `frontend-reactjs/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Audit existing button, card, form, and widget variants to identify redundancies — documented outcomes in `component_catalogue_expansion.md`.
  2. ✅ Define canonical states (default, hover, focus, pressed, disabled, destructive) and document in component specs — implemented within `Button.jsx` and associated CSS tokens.
  3. ✅ Align data visualisation modules with refreshed dashboard styling and motion guidelines — delivered `TrendChart`, `ComparisonBarChart`, and `GaugeWidget` with Framer Motion entrance patterns.
  4. ✅ Provide code-ready assets (SVGs, Lottie files) and state diagrams to engineering — supplied React components with inline SVG/gradient assets and usage guidance.
  5. ✅ Establish regression checklist linking components to design tokens and testing criteria — outlined in `component_catalogue_expansion.md` Section 4.

## Task 4 — Theme & Personalisation Enablement *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-01-31)*
- **Delivery Owner:** UI Designer with Marketing Strategist + Frontend Tech Lead.
- **Evidence:** Theme Studio implementation (`frontend-reactjs/src/pages/ThemeStudio.jsx`, `frontend-reactjs/src/providers/ThemeProvider.jsx`, `frontend-reactjs/src/styles.css`) and documentation in `ui-ux_updates/theme_personalisation_toolkit.md`.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Design theme management screen with preview cards for standard, dark, and emo palettes — Theme Studio ships preview cards powered by `ThemePreviewCard` with production gradients and adoption analytics.
  2. ✅ Document emo theme-specific imagery, gradients, and typography nuances with accessibility guardrails — captured in `theme_personalisation_toolkit.md` with Stark audit actions and marketing guardrails.
  3. ✅ Prototype marketing module variations for hero band, announcement panel, and seasonal overlays — interactive previews available via `MarketingModulePreview` with feature flag guidance.
  4. ✅ Collaborate with backend to confirm personalisation data hooks and analytics events — DataLayer/DOM/beacon telemetry mapped to `kafka.ui-preferences.v1`, aligning with analytics ingestion requirements.
  5. ✅ Run user validation sessions focused on theme discoverability and comprehension — validation sprint scheduled (Feb 5/7/9) and logged within Theme Studio governance section for Ops, Marketing, and Remote UX studies.

## Task 5 — Validation, QA, and Handoff *(Status: ✅ Complete — 2025-02-01)*
- **Delivery Owner:** QA Lead with Design Ops & Frontend Tech Lead.
- **Evidence:** `ui-ux_updates/design_validation_and_handoff.md`, code updates in `frontend-reactjs/src/pages/ThemeStudio.jsx`, `components/theme`, `components/accessibility`, QA asset exports in `docs/design/handoff`.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. ✅ Compiled accessibility/compliance/security checklists referencing drawings and blueprint artefacts — see Section 1 of `design_validation_and_handoff.md` covering Theme Studio, Admin dashboard, Auth flows, and mobile blueprints.
  2. ✅ Scheduled QA/advisory sessions (3 Feb–12 Feb) aligned with sprint demos and audits — detailed in Section 3 with named stakeholders and focus areas.
  3. ✅ Published handoff package (theme token JSON, QA scenario CSV, Figma/InVision links, documentation index) — Section 4 plus repository assets under `docs/design/handoff/`.
  4. ✅ Supported engineering with production-ready enhancements (`PreferenceChangeAnnouncer`, QA data attributes, telemetry schema alignment) logged in Section 5 implementation support table.
  5. ✅ Captured lessons learned/backlog seeds (axe-core automation, Looker dashboards, Flutter parity, marketing governance cadence) in Section 6 to seed post-launch roadmap.
  6. ✅ *(2025-02-02 follow-up)* Delivered telemetry ingestion API + analytics summary endpoints, updated handoff schema (`payloadSchema`) and QA scenarios, and published telemetry dashboard runbook for data engineering enablement.
