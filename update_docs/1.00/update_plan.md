# Update Plan — Version 1.00

## Existing Workstreams
- Refer to baseline product, backend, database, and infrastructure plans for non-UI/UX deliverables.
- All previously approved objectives remain in effect; this document adds UI/UX-focused planning context without superseding earlier artefacts.

## Addendum: UI/UX Design Update Overview
1. **Purpose:** Align application, provider, and web experiences through a unified design system that supports theme flexibility (including emo-style variants) and improved usability.
2. **Scope:** Includes design system foundations, page recomposition, component catalogue updates, theme enablement, and validation/QA alignment across Application and Web design artefacts.
3. **Outcomes:** Deliver consistent visuals, accessible interactions, compliance-ready content, and clear handoff packages for engineering execution.

## Execution Roadmap
- **Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1-2):** Complete token consolidation, typography scale updates, and layout grid definitions.
- **Phase 2 — Experience Blueprints (Weeks 3-4):** Recompose home, dashboard, provider, and marketing pages; integrate security/compliance checkpoints.
- **Phase 3 — Theme Enablement (Week 5):** Release theme management tooling with emo preview support and marketing module variants.
- **Phase 4 — Validation & Handoff (Week 6):** Conduct accessibility, compliance, and QA reviews; deliver implementation packages and regression checklists.

## Coordination & Governance
- Weekly design council sync to manage dependencies and escalate risks.
- Shared documentation index linking to detailed artefacts (`Design_Change_log.md`, `Design_Plan.md`, `Design_update_task_list.md`, `Design_update_milestone_list.md`, `Design_update_progress_tracker.md`).
- Cross-functional checkpoints aligned with engineering sprint demos and product milestones.

## Risk Management Summary
- **Theme Conflicts:** Mitigated via linting and staged rollout of new tokens.
- **Accessibility Regression:** Addressed with dedicated low-vision testing and compliance reviews.
- **QA Coverage:** Managed by integrating design tokens with automated visual regression tooling and manual checklists.
