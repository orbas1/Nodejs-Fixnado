## Issues & Risks (Active)
| ID | Description | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | Need secured credentials for Chatwoot sandbox to unblock integration proof-of-concept. | Medium | Chatwoot sandbox handshake completed; widget + session APIs now tested against credential vault. | Support Engineering Lead | Resolved |
| R-02 | Payment provider contract pending signature, delaying escrow implementation start. | High | Engage finance lead to accelerate contract review; prepare simulated escrow service for early QA. | Commerce Squad Lead | Open |
| R-03 | Validation listener restricted to fixed NAT ranges may block deployments if corporate egress IPs rotate. | Medium | Automate weekly CIDR audit via Terraform pipeline and keep emergency VPN profile documented in runbook. | DevOps Lead | Open |
| R-04 | Marketplace taxonomy drift between environments could break feed and catalogue parity. | Medium | Run nightly taxonomy-integrity CLI checks with checksum alerts and gate deployments on mismatches. | Data Engineering Lead | Open |

## Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-05-09 | Adopt GitHub Actions + Terraform Cloud for automation baseline. | Aligns with team expertise, supports policy-as-code, integrates with existing secrets management. | Programme Manager |
| 2024-05-16 | Standardise on AWS CodeDeploy blue/green deployments with validation listener gating. | Provides zero-downtime cutovers, native rollback, and aligns with Terraform-managed infrastructure. | DevOps Lead |

## Communication Cadence Summary
- **Daily** cross-functional stand-up (DevOps, Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Compliance).
- **Weekly** steering committee (Programme, Product, Compliance, Operations).
- **Bi-weekly** demo/review showcasing automation progress and feed prototypes.

## Metrics to Monitor
- Pipeline success rate & mean duration per stage.
- Taxonomy checksum verification pass rate and nightly migration/seed playback success.
- Moderation queue SLA once timeline hub enters QA.
- Checkout funnel conversion during commerce testing.
- Compliance artefact approval cycle time.
