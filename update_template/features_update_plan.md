| Mobile feature parity slip | Medium | High | Head of Mobile | Maintain weekly parity demos, flag blockers in cross-functional sync | De-scope non-critical animations while retaining CRUD parity |
| Legal policy approval backlog | Low | High | Legal Counsel | Submit drafts by Week 10 with standing review sessions | Publish interim policy notices with update timeline |
| Load testing environment instability | Medium | Medium | DevOps | Provision dedicated performance environment and autoscaling configs | Run scaled-down tests with traffic replay until issues resolved |
| Data migration failures | Low | High | Data Engineering | Automate diff checks and rollback scripts in rehearsal | Invoke hot standby database snapshot and rerun migrations |
| Intelligence moderation false positives | Medium | Medium | Intelligence Squad | Set up precision/recall monitoring, human-in-the-loop escalation | Temporarily widen thresholds and increase manual review coverage |

## Communication & Governance Enhancements
- **Decision Log Rhythm:** Update decision log after every governance meeting with rationale, impacted requirements, and follow-up tasks.
- **Stakeholder Dashboards:** Publish live dashboard summarizing phase progress, risk RAG status, test coverage, and evidence submission counts.
- **Change Control:** Introduce lightweight change control board for scope adjustments; require impact assessment on release readiness items and documentation deliverables.
- **Beta Cohort Feedback Loop:** Engage targeted user cohort during Phases 4–7, collect qualitative feedback, and map findings to backlog items or documentation updates.
- **Launch Command Center:** Define war room tooling (Slack/Teams bridges, incident tracker, runbook repository) and rehearsal schedule two weeks before launch.

## Dependency Tracking Matrix
| Dependency | Needed By | Owner | Status Tracking Method | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|------------------------|-------|
| Chatwoot production credentials | Phase 3 | Support Squad | Governance tracker, weekly sync | Required for live chat load tests |
| Payment gateway sandbox updates | Phase 3 | Commerce Squad | Vendor portal alerts | Coordinate for rentals/materials test cases |
| Firebase project upgrades | Phase 5 | Mobile Infra | Firebase console, mobile standup | Needed for analytics segmentation |
| CDN/Storage contracts (Cloudflare R2/Wasabi) | Phase 3 | Media Squad | Procurement tracker | Choose primary + fallback provider |
| Device lab scheduling | Phase 5 | QA Mobile | Device lab calendar | Reserve peak periods for parity tests |
| Legal review bandwidth | Phase 6 | Legal | Legal ops planner | Align with other corporate commitments |

## Continuous Improvement Hooks
- **Retrospective Cadence:** Hold cross-squad retros at the end of Phases 3, 5, 7, and post-launch to capture lessons learned feeding into Version 1.01 planning.
- **Metric Reviews:** Evaluate key metrics (latency, crash rate, support response, conversion) weekly during Phase 7+ to identify early remediation opportunities.
- **Documentation Refresh Triggers:** Automatically flag documentation sections for review when associated code modules change beyond defined thresholds (e.g., >20% diff or major feature toggle).
- **Automation Debt Ledger:** Track automation gaps discovered during manual testing with prioritization in the next sprint to maintain long-term quality posture.
- **Innovation Backlog:** Log optimization or enhancement ideas surfaced during testing/launch to accelerate follow-up releases without derailing Version 1.00 scope.
