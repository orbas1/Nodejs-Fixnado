# Edulure Version 1.00 – New Feature Brief

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 is a production-ready expansion of Edulure that transforms the platform into a fully interactive learning, community, and commerce ecosystem. The release aligns the web and mobile experiences, introduces comprehensive community chat and collaboration tooling, and ensures robust operational maturity through exhaustive testing, automation, and documentation. All features must launch without stubs or placeholders, uphold strict security, and support high usage scenarios while remaining cost efficient. “Projects” and “Services” footprints are retired entirely so the experience is focused on learning outcomes.

## Strategic Objectives
- Deliver enterprise-grade learner, instructor, and administrator journeys with complete CRUD coverage, real-time collaboration, and optimized performance.
- Provide fully seeded starter data, knowledge bases, and legal documents so the platform can launch immediately in production.
- Implement adaptive recommendations, monetization avenues, and integrations that position Edulure as a scalable education marketplace.
- Reduce infrastructure risk via automated provisioning scripts/UI, observability, load management, and resilience features on every tier.
- Guarantee GitHub site upgrade tooling so future model upgrades can be executed without downtime.

## Feature Pillars
1. **Unified Timeline & Social Layer**
   - Rename the live feed to "Timeline" across web and mobile while enabling ad and recommendation placements in all primary surfaces (timeline stream, sidebar, search, post-live sessions, community feeds, course/e-book/tutor views, profile pages).
   - Embed moderation, reporting, spam detection, follow/unfollow, and access control across timeline, profiles, and communities with live metrics.
   - Integrate Chatwoot-powered support accessible post-login through a floating bubble, mirrored inbox panes in dashboards, and peer-to-peer chat discovery.

2. **Communities & Real-Time Collaboration**
   - Introduce a Discord-like community chat module supporting role-based rooms, broadcast channels, voice/video sessions, media sharing, live events, polls, and moderation tooling.
   - Expand community suites (web and mobile) with CRUD-enabled feeds, classrooms, calendars, livestreams, podcasts, events, scoreboards, maps, members, about sections, and subscription tiers.
   - Provide community-level analytics, live 30-day leaderboards, and side-profile panels with join actions, member/online/admin counts, and role management.

3. **Learning Content & Commerce**
   - Elevate course, e-book, tutor, and live class experiences with high-end styling, responsive layouts, and performant media handling.
   - Support complete purchase, booking, subscription, and payment flows with pricing, skill, qualification, category, SEO, and hashtag tagging plus recommendation hooks.
   - Deliver creation studio workflows for instructors to author courses, assessments, live sessions, and publications efficiently, backed by upload checkers and validation.

4. **Operational Excellence & Compliance**
   - Supply setup/deployment scripts or a dedicated UI, automated database migrations/seeders, and environment templates for every stack component.
   - Conduct comprehensive release readiness testing (unit, load, usage, financial, functionality, error handling, access control, CRUD, timeline, community, AI/internal intelligence, integration, login/registration, dashboard, mobile, security, database, live feed, chat, media, GDPR, etc.).
   - Provide full legal, policy, and documentation suite (Terms, Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, FAQ, README, full guide) and ensure GDPR compliance and audit trails.

5. **Intelligent Matching & Personalization**
   - Enhance recommendation engines for tags, skills, qualifications, categories, pricing, SEO, and hashtag relevancy across search, feeds, and detail pages using lightweight in-house algorithms and rule-based scoring.
   - Implement internal assistance services (heuristics, smaller models, deterministic workflows) within communities, timeline, and dashboards to surface insights, detect anomalies, and aid moderation without relying on heavy external AI infrastructure.

## Comprehensive Logic Flows
### Platform Entry & Identity
1. **Visitor → Registration → Role Assignment**
   - Display simplified language dropdown (single-word labels) and streamlined nomenclature across all entry points.
   - Support email/social logins (Google, Apple, LinkedIn, Facebook) and step-up verification (2FA, ID verification requests) with secure session handling.
   - Post-registration, route to role selector (learner, instructor, admin) and tailor dashboards accordingly; ensure mobile parity via role changer screen.

2. **Authentication → Access Control Enforcement**
   - Apply RBAC and access control tests to every page load, API route, WebSocket connection, chat channel, and mobile view.
   - Log session telemetry for uptime helper, audit trails, and security analytics with configurable retention.

### Timeline (Live Feed) Lifecycle
1. **Content Creation Flow**
   - Users create posts (text, media, live sessions, ads) → upload checker validates assets → bad word/spam scanner → timeline moderation queue → publish to timeline with tagging and recommendation metadata.
2. **Consumption & Interaction Flow**
   - Timeline renders personalized feed (ads, recommendations, live classes, community updates) → responsive components ensure no text wrapping overflow → interactions (follow/unfollow, reactions, comments, reports, shares) propagate via WebSocket/socket.io in real time.
3. **Monitoring & Monetization Flow**
   - Ads/recommendations served with analytics callbacks → financial reporting aggregates conversions → admins audit placements via dashboard, enforce pricing matching, and adjust campaigns.

### Community Ecosystem Flow
1. **Community Discovery → Join**
   - Explorer search surfaces communities using category/skill/qualification/price/zone matching → detail view showcases profile, map, leaderboard, membership stats → join action respects subscription/free tier logic and handles payment tiers.
2. **Engagement & Collaboration**
   - Community feed, chat, classrooms, events, podcasts, live streams, scoreboards, and maps operate on real-time updates with CRUD operations, moderation, and media handling.
3. **Management**
   - Instructors/admins configure roles, chat rooms, safety settings, monetization, integrations, and analytics via modular dashboards with governance workflows and audit logs.

### Learning & Commerce Flow
1. **Course/E-book/Tutor Discovery**
   - Explorer search merges tags, SEO, skill, qualification, pricing, zone availability, and trending signals to rank results across web and mobile.
2. **Evaluation & Purchase**
   - Product detail pages deliver high-quality media, structured sections, breadcrumbs with concise labeling, and CTA flows → payment services orchestrate checkout, handle taxes, and trigger receipts/refund eligibility.
3. **Fulfillment & Progress**
   - Learner dashboards track course progress, assessments, live sessions, finance, and support tickets → instructors manage content, bookings, community add-ons, and revenue analytics.

### Support & Operations Flow
1. **Support Requests**
   - Users invoke Chatwoot bubble → choose help center articles, peer chats, or staff support → attachments, emojis, GIFs supported → escalations mirrored in dashboard inbox.
2. **Deployment & Maintenance**
   - DevOps scripts/UI provision infrastructure, apply database migrations/seeders, configure integrations (Hubspot, Google, Salesforce, optional lightweight OpenAI API usage, SMTP, Firebase, Cloudflare R2/Wasabi/local storage) → monitoring ensures uptime, load balancing, and failover.
3. **Testing & Compliance**
   - Execute exhaustive test suites (unit to mobile parity) before release → document outcomes in release checklist (including zone, service purchase, rentals, and material purchase validations) → update README, guides, starter data snapshots, and GitHub upgrade notes.
