        "Fixnado is a service orchestration marketplace owned and operated by Blackwellen Ltd. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information when individuals visit our websites, use the Fixnado mobile applications, interact with our communications, or engage with our professional services. It also sets out the safeguards we apply to protect information, the legal bases relied upon for processing, and the controls we make available to customers, providers, and enterprise partners. The Policy supplements any product-specific statements and applies alongside contractual terms agreed with organisations using the Fixnado ecosystem.",
        "Protecting privacy is foundational to our brand and to the trust we maintain with contractors, enterprise buyers, field teams, and consumers. Our compliance program aligns with UK GDPR, EU GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and other international regulations that affect Blackwellen Ltd and its subsidiaries. We apply privacy by design and security by default principles across the lifecycle of each product change, and our governance forums review this Policy at least twice annually to ensure it remains accurate, transparent, and ready for operational use."

        "Blackwellen Ltd is a private limited company registered in England and Wales (company number 11223344) with its principal place of business at 14 Glasshouse Yard, London, EC1A 4JN, United Kingdom. Blackwellen Ltd is the data controller for the personal information described in this Policy unless a different entity is identified in a specific contract or supplement. Our subsidiaries and trusted resellers may act as data processors when delivering Fixnado services under our direction, and each contract includes privacy, confidentiality, and security obligations that mirror this Policy.",
        "We maintain a designated Data Protection Officer (DPO) and privacy governance office reachable at privacy@fixnado.com. They coordinate regional representatives for the European Union, North America, LATAM, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East to ensure local regulatory alignment. Blackwellen Ltd has appointed an EU representative under Article 27 GDPR, and we maintain records of processing activities for all Fixnado products. These governance measures ensure the commitments in this Privacy Policy have accountable owners and measurable controls."

It governs how data is handled when users create profiles, browse listings, make or receive bookings, conduct payments through escrow, request support, or integrate Fixnado with enterprise systems.",
        "The Policy does not cover aggregated or anonymised data that can no longer identify a person, nor does it apply to third-party services accessed via integrations where the third party acts as an independent controller. In those scenarios, users should review the privacy statements of the relevant provider. Where Fixnado processes data on behalf of enterprise customers as a processor, the terms of the underlying data processing agreement will prevail, but we still provide this Policy to maintain transparency about our standard practices."

Product squads must complete a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for new or high-risk features and submit the results to the Privacy Office before release. Our legal, compliance, and security teams maintain a joint change control board that reviews policy changes, monitors regulatory developments, and ensures training coverage across all staff.",
        "We maintain mandatory privacy training for employees, contractors, and temporary workers with annual refreshers and scenario-based simulations. Access to production systems requires multi-factor authentication, device posture compliance, and completion of privacy awareness modules. Audit logs are monitored for anomalies, and breaches of this Policy may result in disciplinary action or termination of vendor contracts. These governance steps ensure that privacy is treated as a continuous operational responsibility."

When special category data is processed, we apply heightened safeguards, minimise the scope, and rely on explicit consent or applicable legal exemptions.",

Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided information should contact privacy@fixnado.com so we can address the situation swiftly.",

When relying on legitimate interests, we perform a balancing test to confirm that our interests are not overridden by the rights and freedoms of data subjects.",
        "Outside the UK and EU, we align with applicable local laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and relevant state or provincial statutes.

Automated outcomes are monitored by operations specialists, and humans always retain the ability to override or adjust assignments. We do not deploy algorithms that produce significant legal effects without meaningful human involvement.",

Operational logs, telemetry, and audit trails are typically retained for 24 months unless extended to investigate security incidents or legal claims.",

Audit logs capture every access attempt and are subject to behavioural analytics to detect anomalies.",
