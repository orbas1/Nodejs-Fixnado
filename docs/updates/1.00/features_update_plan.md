# Fixnado Version 1.00 – Features Update Plan

## Phase 0 – Scope Reset & Governance Alignment
1. **Scope Correction Workshops**
   - Remove course, instructor, and learner assumptions from backlogs, schemas, designs, and copy; confirm marketplace-first language and data structures.
   - Ratify persona definitions (user, serviceman, crew, provider/business, enterprise, admin) and ensure every requirement maps to at least one persona journey.
2. **Logic Flow Sign-off**
   - Produce BPMN or sequence diagrams for onboarding, role change, timeline hub (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed), storefront, checkout, dashboard, support, and deployment flows before coding.
   - Validate zone coverage, finance integration, and communications escalation logic with stakeholders to prevent late rework.
3. **Governance & Risk Registers**
   - Stand up decision logs, risk registers, dependency matrices, and GitHub upgrade workflows aligned to release readiness expectations.
   - Define documentation templates for changelog, update brief, full guide, and compliance evidence.

**Exit Criteria**
- Approved traceability matrix linking every release readiness requirement to features/tasks.
- Published logic flow diagrams signed off by product, engineering, operations, and compliance.
- Active governance artefacts (risk register, decision log, upgrade workflow) accessible to all teams.

## Phase 1 – Infrastructure, Security & Deployment Automation
1. **Deployment Tooling**
   - Build bash scripts/UI for provisioning, configuration, scaling, blue/green, and rollback; include environment validation and credential checks.
2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Finalise `.env` templates, secrets storage, and configuration modules for backend, frontend, mobile, and infrastructure stacks.
3. **Security Hardening**
   - Enforce RBAC, access policies, rate limiting, encryption, audit logging, GDPR compliance hooks, and file submission protections across all services.
4. **Observability & Load Preparedness**
   - Implement uptime helper dashboards, load balancers, RAM/CPU profiling, stress alerts, and logging pipelines integrated with Chatwoot/support analytics.

**Exit Criteria**
- Automated deployments run end-to-end in staging with rollback validation.
- Security review signs off RBAC, encryption, logging, and upload controls.
- Observability dashboards live with thresholds configured and alert routing in place.

## Phase 2 – Data Foundations, Taxonomies & Seeders
1. **Taxonomy Authoring**
   - Create exhaustive catalogues for service categories, tools, materials, zones (countries/regions/areas), skills, qualifications, SEO tags, hashtags, pricing tiers.
2. **Matching & Intelligence Rules**
   - Define deterministic matching rules and lightweight scoring algorithms for recommendations, pricing, skills, qualifications, and spam detection.
3. **Seeder & Migration Engineering**
   - Develop migrations and seeders for all catalogues, storefront templates, dashboard widgets, timeline hub content (including custom job and marketplace feed samples), and policy placeholders.
4. **Documentation & Knowledge Base Skeletons**
   - Outline README update, full guide, starter data reference, GitHub upgrade manual, and policy structure for later drafting.

**Exit Criteria**
- Seeders execute successfully with validation scripts proving referential integrity.
- Matching rules documented with configuration options and fallback behaviours.
- Draft documentation outlines approved by product, ops, and compliance.

## Phase 3 – Core Backend Services & Integrations
1. **Timeline & Communications Services**
   - Rename live feed to timeline in code, events, analytics; build CRUD timeline APIs with moderation, ads, recommendations, follow/unfollow, reporting, spam detection.
   - Introduce timeline hub orchestration that segments content into Timeline, Custom Job Feed, and Marketplace Feed endpoints with prioritisation logic, analytics, and notification hooks.
2. **Marketplace & Commerce Services**
   - Deliver services, rentals, materials, storefront, business front, checkout, escrow, wallet, finance, tax, invoice, refund, and analytics APIs.
   - Integrate payment gateways with transactional safety, audit logs, and reconciliation endpoints.
3. **Support & Escalation Services**
   - Connect Chatwoot APIs for inbox, attachments, emojis, GIFs, search/discovery; embed support tickets across dashboards.
4. **Integration Enablement**
   - Configure adapters for Hubspot, Salesforce, Google, SMTP, Firebase, Cloudflare R2/Wasabi/local storage, OAuth providers, and optional AI services.

**Exit Criteria**
- Backend services deployed to staging with contract and load tests passing.
- Financial transactions (service purchase, rentals, materials) reconcile successfully in sandbox.
- Timeline, recommendation, and support services sustain concurrency/usage targets.

## Phase 4 – Web Application Delivery
1. **Design System & Layout Overhaul**
   - Build enterprise-grade components, responsive containers, simplified copy (1–2 word labels), and mega menu/navigation patterns.
2. **Timeline & Communications UX**
   - Implement renamed timeline hub with tabbed navigation (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed), responsive cards, ads/recommendations placements, reporting, moderation, and media handling tuned for each feed.
   - Surface analytics, saved filters, and notification settings that help users jump between feeds quickly without introducing standalone community modules.
3. **Marketplace & Dashboard Experiences**
   - Ship explorer/search, storefront, business front, creation wizard, service/rental/material viewers, and checkout flows with high-fidelity styling and CRUD interactions.
   - Complete dashboards for user, serviceman, crew, provider, enterprise, admin including finance, escrow, tax, metrics, pipeline, roster, hub, settings, inbox.
4. **Policies & Knowledge Base Pages**
   - Publish Terms, Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, About, FAQ, README, full guide, and GitHub upgrade page with production-ready styling.

**Exit Criteria**
- UX review confirms responsive layout, no text wrapping, consistent styling, and correct nomenclature.
- Ads and recommendation slots validated across mandated surfaces.
- Policies and documentation accessible and linked throughout navigation.

## Phase 5 – Mobile (Flutter) Parity & Optimisation
1. **Navigation & Structure**
   - Implement splash, role changer, bottom tab navigation, contextual menus, and timeline rename alignment.
2. **Feature Parity**
   - Port timeline hub tabs, explorer, service/rental/material viewers, storefront, business front, dashboards, support, ads, recommendations, inbox, settings.
3. **Performance & Compliance**
   - Optimise media handling, offline caching, Firebase integrations, diagnostics, privacy prompts, and App Store/Play Store compliance including in-app purchases or deep links.
4. **Testing & Device Coverage**
   - Execute device matrix tests, integration/golden tests, UI automation, and stress tests for media streaming and push notifications.

**Exit Criteria**
- Feature parity checklist signed off by mobile/product leads.
- Device lab results meeting performance, RAM, and battery targets.
- Store submission assets prepared with compliance evidence.

## Phase 6 – Testing, Documentation & Launch Readiness
1. **Full Testing Matrix**
   - Orchestrate unit, integration, load, stress, usage, financial, functionality, error handling, access control, CRUD, timeline, AI, integration, login/registration, dashboard, mobile, zone, service purchase, rental, material purchase, GDPR, bad word/spam, report button, upload checker tests.
2. **Observability & Incident Response**
   - Finalise telemetry dashboards, logging, alerting, incident response runbooks, escalation ladders, and war room drills.
3. **Documentation & Release Artefacts**
   - Complete README, full guide, starter data catalogues, policies, changelog, update brief, end-of-update report, and GitHub upgrade instructions.

**Exit Criteria**
- Testing evidence compiled with pass/fail status and remediation logs.
- Observability stack validated in pre-production rehearsal with rollback drill.
- Documentation package reviewed by legal, ops, and leadership with sign-off for production launch.
