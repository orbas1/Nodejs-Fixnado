# Fixnado Version 1.00 – Priority Features to Add

## Top-Level Focus Areas
- **Production Launch Tooling** – Automated setup/deployment scripts or UI, environment validation, rollback rehearsals, and observability dashboards that guarantee a safe day-one launch.
- **Marketplace Operations Suite** – Timeline rename with a three-tab timeline hub (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed), full CRUD commerce for services, rentals, materials, and embedded finance/escrow/tax controls inside every dashboard.
- **Compliance & Knowledge Base** – UK-compliant legal pages, GDPR-ready governance, README/full guide refresh, starter data catalogues, and GitHub upgrade instructions to support future releases.
- **Mobile & Support Parity** – Flutter app parity with web, Chatwoot-powered support inbox, floating chat bubble, and responsive UX for multi-device audiences.

## Detailed Feature Capsules
1. **Release Automation & Reliability**
   - Deployment orchestration CLI/UI handling provisioning, configuration, blue/green, rollback, and health verification.
   - Database migration and seeder pipelines with integrity audits and sample data for services, rentals, materials, ads, zones, tags.
   - Uptime helper dashboards, load balancer configuration, RAM/CPU profiling, and stress/load test harnesses integrated into CI.
2. **Timeline & Engagement Layer**
   - Live feed rename to a “Timeline Hub” with Timeline, Custom Job Feed, and Marketplace Feed tabs; each feed includes responsive cards, ads/recommendation slots, follow/unfollow, reporting, spam/bad-word scanning, and analytics overlays.
   - Feed orchestration services that score content, prioritise monetisation slots, and highlight urgent items (e.g., expiring custom jobs, marketplace restocks) without introducing standalone community modules.
   - Recommendation services using deterministic rules and lightweight models for tag/skill/qualification/price matching.
3. **Commerce & Dashboard Experiences**
   - Explorer/search spanning zones, service categories, providers, servicemen, tools, materials with advanced filters and CRUD operations.
   - Storefronts, business fronts, tool/material/service viewers, checkout flows, rentals lifecycle, wallet/escrow/tax dashboards, and integrated finance metrics per persona.
   - Role dashboards (user, serviceman, crew, provider, enterprise, admin) featuring pipeline, calendar, roster, hub, metrics, support, settings, and embedded finance controls.
4. **Support, Policies & Documentation**
   - Chatwoot integration accessible via floating bubble (post-login) and dashboard inbox with attachments, emojis, GIFs, and peer discovery.
   - Terms, Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, About, FAQ, README, full guide, onboarding tutorials, and GitHub upgrade documentation.
   - Bad word/spam filters, report buttons, RBAC enforcement, upload checker, and GDPR tooling across all interactive surfaces.
5. **Mobile Application Parity**
   - Flutter navigation with splash, role changer, bottom tabs, timeline hub tabs (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed), explorer, storefront, dashboards, support, ads, and recommendations.
   - Media handling, Firebase messaging/analytics/crashlytics, offline caching, in-app purchases or deep links, and device matrix automation for QA.
