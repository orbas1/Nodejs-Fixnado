## Notes & Next Steps
- Populate the tracker after each subtask demo or code merge; update overall score by averaging the six preceding columns.
- Attach links to telemetry dashboards, CI runs, QA evidence, and documentation approvals as they materialise.
- Use the tracker to feed the end-of-update report and Version 1.50 planning brief.
