# Fixnado Version 1.00 – Issue Report

## Overview
The current codebase and planning artefacts still reflect the abandoned “learning” concept. Mission-critical marketplace functionality, deployment automation, and compliance materials are either missing or misaligned. Without a structured remediation effort Fixnado cannot ship a production-ready release.

## Detailed Findings
### A. Release Engineering
- No automated provisioning scripts or deployment UI exist, forcing manual environment setup with no rollback safety.
- Database migrations are destructive and lack deterministic seeders, preventing starter data for services, rentals, materials, zones, or tags.
- Observability is minimal; there is no uptime helper, load balancer configuration, RAM profiling, or stress/load test harnesses.

### B. Security & Compliance
- RBAC, access control, and audit logging are inconsistent. Learner/instructor leftovers expose unauthorised navigation and API access.
- Upload checker, file submission protection, spam/bad-word scanners, report buttons, and GDPR tooling are missing across web/mobile.
- Legal artefacts (Terms, Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, FAQ, About) are absent; no acknowledgement flow or retention schedule exists.

### C. Marketplace Experience
- Service, rental, and material modules are fragmented. Finance, escrow, tax, wallet, and payment management are not embedded inside user, serviceman, crew, provider, enterprise, or admin dashboards.
- Explorer/search cannot filter by zones, categories, skills, qualifications, SEO tags, hashtags, or pricing; zone catalogues and matching logic are missing.
- Storefronts, business fronts, timeline monetisation slots, and recommendation placements are missing or static; follow/unfollow and reporting are incomplete.

### D. Timeline Hub & Support
- The live feed retains learner-oriented naming. Timeline hub requirements (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed tabs, ads, recommendations, moderation, follow/unfollow, analytics) are absent.
- No orchestration prioritises urgent custom jobs or marketplace inventory updates, leaving feeds without actionable insights for dashboards.
- Chatwoot support integration is missing. There is no floating bubble, dashboard inbox, attachments, emoji/GIF support, or direct link to the help centre.

### E. Mobile Application
- Flutter retains course/learner flows. Role changer onboarding, dashboards, storefront, timeline rename, support bubble, and CRUD commerce features are unimplemented.
- Mobile networking lacks diagnostics, offline strategies, Firebase messaging/analytics/crashlytics, and App Store compliance (in-app purchases/deep links).
- Performance work (media handling, RAM/battery profiling, stress tests) has not started.

### F. Documentation & Knowledge Base
- README, full guide, starter data catalogue, and GitHub upgrade playbooks are outdated or non-existent.
- There is no structured changelog, update brief, testing plan, or progress tracker tied to release readiness metrics.
- Operational playbooks (support SOPs, maintenance mode, training) are missing, risking handover failure.

## Risk Summary
- **High** – Deployment automation, RBAC gaps, and missing finance controls make production launch unsafe.
- **Medium** – Lack of documentation and support tooling hinders adoption and operations even if the platform launches.
- **Low** – Cosmetic inconsistencies (naming, text wrapping) compared to functional blockers but still required for enterprise polish.
