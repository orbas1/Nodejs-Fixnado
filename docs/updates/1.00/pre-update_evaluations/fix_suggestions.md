# Fixnado Version 1.00 â€“ Fix Suggestions

## Release Engineering Remedies
- Build deployment scripts/UI for provisioning, configuration, blue/green, and rollback with health verification and automated environment smoke tests.
- Introduce transactional migrations, reversible schema changes, and deterministic seeders covering services, rentals, materials, zones, skills, qualifications, SEO tags, and hashtags.
- Stand up observability stack: uptime helper dashboards, load balancers, RAM/CPU profiling, log aggregation, stress/load/usage test harnesses integrated into CI.

## Security & Compliance Hardening
- Implement RBAC across API, web, mobile, WebSocket, and storage layers; retire course/learner artefacts and refactor navigation/permissions for marketplace personas.
- Deploy upload checker, antivirus scanning, spam/bad-word detection, report buttons, audit trails, and GDPR tooling (consent, subject access, retention policies).
- Draft and publish UK-compliant Terms, Privacy, Refund, Community Guidelines, About, FAQ, and integrate acknowledgement flows and documentation change logs.

## Marketplace & Commerce Completion
- Consolidate services, rentals, and materials into full CRUD flows with storefronts, business fronts, explorer filters, checkout, wallet, escrow, finance, tax, and analytics embedded within each dashboard.
- Implement recommendation and pricing engines driven by deterministic rules/lightweight models utilising taxonomy data.
- Rename live feed to timeline across copy, routes, analytics; add ad/recommendation slots, follow/unfollow, reporting, moderation dashboards, and monetisation tracking.

## Timeline Hub & Support Enablement
- Build the timeline hub with Timeline, Custom Job Feed, and Marketplace Feed tabs, including prioritisation logic, saved filters, ad/recommendation slots, moderation tooling, and analytics dashboards.
- Integrate Chatwoot for support bubble (post-login), dashboard inbox, attachments, emojis, GIFs, peer discovery, and help center linking.
- Create analytics for feed health, support performance, and timeline engagement feeding dashboards and release readiness reporting.

-## Mobile Parity & Optimisation
-## Mobile Parity & Optimisation
- Implement splash, role changer, bottom tabs, timeline hub tabs, explorer, storefront, dashboards, checkout, support bubble, and settings in Flutter.
- Add Firebase messaging/analytics/crashlytics, offline caching strategies, media optimisation, diagnostics, and App Store/Play Store compliance (in-app purchases or deep links).
- Run device matrix tests, stress tests for media delivery/notifications, and integrate CI automation for regression coverage.

## Documentation & Operational Readiness
- Refresh README, full guide, starter data catalogue, GitHub upgrade instructions, changelog, update brief, testing plan, and end-of-update report templates.
- Produce training materials, support/maintenance playbooks, escalation ladders, and war room procedures.
- Maintain progress tracker and milestone dashboards tied to release readiness metrics for transparent governance.
