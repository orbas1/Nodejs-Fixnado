# Fixnado Version 1.00 – New Feature Brief

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 pivots Fixnado away from the accidental “learning platform” direction and reasserts it as a production-grade field service, tooling, and materials marketplace. The release removes learner- and course-specific mechanics, replaces them with trade-focused flows, and hardens every tier for live operations. The update must reach production readiness with complete deployment automation, exhaustive testing, documentation, and seeded data so organisations can stand up Fixnado without manual rework or placeholder content.

## Strategic Objectives
- **Re-scope the platform** to service crews, providers, enterprises, and administrators—eliminating course/instructor artefacts while retaining only modules that support Fixnado’s marketplace, logistics, and operational oversight.
- **Achieve release readiness** with automated setup, CI-verified migrations and seeders, live-service testing, and rollback procedures that make the launch safe on day one.
- **Deliver complete dashboards and journeys** for every persona (user, serviceman, crew, provider, enterprise, admin) including finance, escrow, tax, compliance, and analytics views embedded into their core workflows instead of a detached finance console.
- **Establish resilient communications and support tooling** by integrating a global support inbox powered by Chatwoot, renaming the live feed to a moderated, monetisable timeline suite with dedicated Timeline, Custom Job Feed, and Marketplace Feed tabs, and providing escalation workflows that link feed signals to operations teams.
- **Codify compliance and documentation** with UK-compliant policies, GDPR tooling, full guides, README, starter data, and governance artefacts so legal and operational teams can certify the product.
- **Optimise performance and cost** via high-usage load management, RAM/server stress mitigation, caching, and observability to ensure Fixnado can sustain enterprise traffic profiles.

## Feature Pillars
1. **Release Readiness & Automation**
   - Build turnkey setup through bash scripts and/or deployment UI, covering infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and blue/green releases.
   - Automate database migrations, seeders, and environment templates with verification hooks, ensuring full starter data and rollback plans.
   - Instrument live service monitoring (uptime helper, load balancing, RAM/CPU profiling) and document release rehearsal procedures.
2. **Operational Marketplace & Commerce**
   - Provide CRUD-complete modules for services, rentals, and material purchases with pricing, zone, qualification, and skill matching.
   - Deliver storefronts, business fronts, and explorer/search experiences spanning zones, service categories, providers, servicemen, tools, and materials.
   - Embed finance, escrow, tax, wallet, and payments management inside every dashboard, supporting service purchases, rentals, and material orders.
3. **Timeline, Communications & Engagement**
   - Rename the live feed to a tabbed “Timeline Hub” containing Timeline, Custom Job Feed, and Marketplace Feed views, each tuned for relevant signals, monetisation slots, and moderation.
   - Equip every feed with ad placements, recommendation widgets, reporting, spam detection, follow/unfollow controls, media handling, and analytics overlays that surface actionable insights to dashboards.
   - Deliver Chatwoot-based support across floating chat bubbles (post-login), dashboard inbox, and contact discovery, supporting attachments, emojis, and GIFs alongside structured escalation rules.
4. **Taxonomy, Matching & Intelligence**
   - Create exhaustive catalogues for service categories, tool types, materials, zones, skills, qualifications, SEO tags, hashtags, and pricing bands.
   - Implement deterministic and lightweight intelligence services for tag matching, recommendations, and bad word/spam scanning while remaining resource efficient.
   - Provide tagging governance, RBAC, GDPR data management, and audit trails across all modules.
5. **Compliance, Policies & Knowledge Base**
   - Draft UK-compliant Terms (4–5k words), Privacy Policy (3–5k), Refund Policy (2.5–5k), Community Guidelines (5k), About Us (500 words), and FAQ (500–1k words).
   - Publish full guides, README refresh, onboarding walkthroughs, release notes, and GitHub upgrade documentation to make future updates predictable.
   - Ensure RBAC, access control tests, and audit logging cover all channels (web, API, mobile, WebSocket, storage).

## Comprehensive Logic Flows
### Identity & Role Assignment
1. **Registration & Role Selection**
   - Provide succinct language dropdown (single-word labels) and simplified copy during registration.
   - Support email and social logins (Google, Apple, LinkedIn, Facebook) plus 2FA and ID verification for sensitive roles.
   - Immediately route users to a role changer that selects user, serviceman, provider, enterprise, or admin dashboards with contextual onboarding.
2. **Access Control Enforcement**
   - Apply RBAC on every route, API, WebSocket channel, chat room, dashboard widget, and admin action.
   - Log access attempts for security analytics, uptime helper dashboards, and compliance audits.

### Timeline & Communications Ecosystem
1. **Content Creation & Moderation**
   - Users craft posts (text, media, service promos, ads) → upload checker validates media → bad word/spam scanner filters → moderation queue → publish into the appropriate feed (Timeline, Custom Job Feed, Marketplace Feed) with tags, SEO metadata, and monetisation eligibility.
2. **Multi-Feed Rendering & Monetisation**
   - Tabbed timeline hub renders three feeds with responsive layouts that prevent text wrapping; each feed balances organic updates with ads, recommendations, and zone-aware highlights relevant to its focus area.
   - Follow/unfollow, reactions, comments, reports, shares, and live metrics propagate in real time via socket.io while moderation dashboards triage escalations and update analytics counters per feed.
3. **Signal Routing & Escalation**
   - Feed events trigger analytics, notification, and escalation workflows (e.g., high-value custom job requests, marketplace stockouts) that notify dashboards, support teams, and operations war rooms for rapid response.

### Marketplace & Commerce Flow
1. **Discovery & Evaluation**
   - Explorer/search indexes zones, service categories, providers, servicemen, tools, materials with tag, qualification, and pricing filters.
   - Storefronts and business fronts display branding, showcases, reviews, deals, inventory, and availability by zone.
2. **Checkout & Fulfilment**
   - Purchases (services, rentals, materials) go through secure checkout with escrow options, wallet integration, and financial/tax handling.
   - Orders feed dashboards (user, serviceman, provider, crew, enterprise) with status tracking, scheduling, payments, metrics, and support actions.
3. **Operations & Analytics**
   - Dashboards surface pipeline, calendar, roster, metrics, finance, escrow, tax, and compliance widgets tailored to each role.
   - Admin controls cover zones, system management, disputes, documents, GDPR, maintenance mode, and appearance management.

### Support & Knowledge Base
1. **Support Entry Points**
   - Floating Chatwoot bubble (post-login) links to https://support.edulure.com, enabling live chat, help center browsing, and user-to-user conversations.
   - Dashboard inbox and top-bar preview provide quick access to ongoing conversations.
2. **Escalation & Reporting**
   - Report buttons across timeline feeds, storefront, and dashboard widgets feed moderation queues with audit logs.
   - Attachments, emojis, and GIFs are permitted with file submission protection and malware scanning.

### Deployment & Testing Lifecycle
1. **Environment Provisioning**
   - Deployment scripts/UI orchestrate infrastructure, apply migrations/seeders, configure integrations (Hubspot, Salesforce, Google, SMTP, Firebase, Cloudflare R2/Wasabi/local storage), and toggle environment variables.
2. **Testing Pipeline**
   - Execute unit, integration, load, stress, usage, security, financial, functionality, error handling, access control, CRUD, timeline, AI, integration, login/registration, dashboard, mobile, zone, service purchase, rental, material purchase, live feed (timeline hub), GDPR, and bad word/spam tests.
3. **Observability & Release**
   - Monitor uptime helper dashboards, load balancers, RAM profiles, analytics, and logs; rehearse blue/green releases and rollback drills before production cutover.
