# Version 1.00 Update Change Log

- Initialised the v1.00 evaluation workspace by cloning the update template and preparing documentation scaffolding for backend, front-end, database, dependency, and user app tracks.
- Logged comprehensive pre-update evaluation findings across all tracks to inform remediation planning ahead of the v1.00 rollout.
- Expanded evaluations with deployment-readiness risks (auto-starting backend, destructive migrations, client-side persona escalation) and refreshed shared issue tracking with the newly identified blockers.
- Completed deep-dive scans across backend, web, mobile, and dependency surfaces to surface new cross-cutting security and telemetry gaps, and re-ran local build commands to verify current installation failures.
